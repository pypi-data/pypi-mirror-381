Description: 
        Lemonade is a Python port of the LEMON Parser Generator written by
        D. Richard Hipp:
        
            http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/
        
        Lemonade can be used in the traditional fashion to create a standalone
        parser:
        
            lemonade gram.y
        
        The above command generates "gram.py", which you can include in your
        project.
        
        Since Python is a dynamic language, Lemonade could also enable client
        software to generate a parser from a user-supplied .y file, and then
        use the generated parser on the fly.
        
        This is the beta release of Lemonade.  There is no documentation yet.
        You may find the original LEMON documentation helpful:

        However, many of LEMON's "%" directives are irrelevant in Python;
        therefore, they have been eliminated in Lemonade.  Further, Lemonade
        does not allow code fragments ("{}") within the grammar file.
        Instead, the reduce actions are specified in a separate delegate
        class.  See the 'examples' directory for an example.
