# Version 1.0.18 and dependency updates

## Summary

- Bump package version to `1.0.18`.
- Move `pydantic-ai` from runtime dependencies to the `dev` dependency group.

## Rationale

- Keep the runtime footprint minimal and focused on core conversion features.
- `pydantic-ai` is only needed for development workflows and examples.

## Affected file

- `pyproject.toml`:
  - `version = "1.0.18"`
  - Remove `pydantic-ai` from `[project].dependencies`.
  - Add `pydantic-ai` to `[dependency-groups].dev`.

## Compatibility

- No runtime breaking changes. Existing consumers do not require `pydantic-ai` unless working on development features that reference it explicitly.
