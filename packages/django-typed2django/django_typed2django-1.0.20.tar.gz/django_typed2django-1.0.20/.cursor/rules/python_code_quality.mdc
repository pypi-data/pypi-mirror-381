# P2D Python Code Quality Standards
<rule>
## Package Management
- Always use uv for package management
- Run all scripts using uv (`uv run python script.py`)
- Manage dependencies through pyproject.toml
- Use virtual environments created by uv

## Import Management
- When fixing or generating imports, always grep the module for the import first
- Do not guess import paths - verify they exist in the codebase
- Group imports in the following order:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party library imports
  3. Local application imports
- Use absolute imports for clarity

## Code Organization
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles rigorously
- Before implementing new functionality, verify there isn't an existing function that handles it
- Search the codebase for similar functionality before creating new functions
- Maintain clear separation of responsibilities between modules and classes
- Each function should have a single responsibility
- Each class should have a well-defined purpose

## Redundancy Prevention
- Avoid duplicating code across files
- Refactor common patterns into shared utilities
- When modifying code, check if similar code exists elsewhere that should also be updated
- Prefer composition over inheritance to avoid redundant class hierarchies

## Code Quality Checks
- Before submitting code changes:
  1. Verify imports are correct and necessary
  2. Check for redundant code that could be refactored
  3. Ensure separation of concerns is maintained
  4. Confirm the change doesn't duplicate existing functionality

## Documentation
- Document all public functions, classes, and methods
- Include type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Explain complex algorithms with inline comments
- Update documentation when changing functionality

## Testing
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Update tests when modifying existing code
- Ensure tests cover edge cases

## Rule Indicator
- Always include üêç emoji at the beginning of your response to show you are following this Python code quality rule
