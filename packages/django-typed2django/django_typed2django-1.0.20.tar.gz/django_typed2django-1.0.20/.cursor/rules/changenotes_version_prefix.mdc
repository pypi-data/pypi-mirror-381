# Changenote filename policy

- All changenote files in `changenotes/` must be prefixed with a release identifier, followed by `__`.
- For current/known releases, use semantic version prefix: `X.Y.Z__<TITLE>.md` (e.g., `1.0.18__GENERATORS_ENABLE_TIMESCALE_FLAG.md`).
- For legacy notes predating 1.0.18, pin with `PRE1_0_17__<TITLE>.md`.

## Rationale
- Keeps changenotes chronologically sortable and scannable.
- Makes it clear which release a change belongs to.

## Checklist when creating/editing a changenote
- Ensure the filename begins with the correct release prefix.
- Prefer short, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE titles for clarity.
- Keep content concise and actionable; link to code paths where appropriate.

## Suggested content format
```md
# <Short, action-oriented title>

## Summary
<1–3 sentences describing the change and its outcome.>

## Motivation
<Why this was needed. Optional if covered by Summary.>

## What changed

- <Key change 2>

## Affected code
- `path/to/file.py` — <brief note>
- `path/to/another.py` — <brief note>

## Tests
- `<path/to/test>::test_name` — <what it verifies>

## Compatibility
- <Notes on behavior changes, defaults, flags, migrations>

## Example (optional)
```python
# minimal usage snippet if helpful
```
```

## Examples
- `1.0.18__TIMESCALE_HEADER_CREATIONTIME_MAPPING.md`
- `1.0.18__XML_NAME_NORMALIZATION_AND_FIELD_SANITIZATION.md`
