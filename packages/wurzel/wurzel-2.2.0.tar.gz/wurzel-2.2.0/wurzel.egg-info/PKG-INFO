The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
        
             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

# wurzel
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/telekom/wurzel/main/docs/icon.png width=20% align=right>


wurzel is the german word for [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root). So with this framework we provide a combination of the best out of the whole domain of retrieval and beyond.

wurzel is an open-source Python library built to address advanced **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** needs for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems. It is designed to streamline ETL processes while offering essential features like **multi-tenancy**, **cloud-native deployment support**, and **job scheduling**.

The repository includes initial implementations for widely-used frameworks in the RAG ecosystem, such as Qdrant, Milvus, and Hugging Face, providing users with a strong starting point for building scalable and efficient RAG pipelines.

![Sample Pipeline](docs/sample-pipeline.excalidraw.svg)
## Features

- **Advanced ETL Pipelines**: Tailored for the specific needs of RAG systems.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Easily manage multiple tenants or projects within a single system.
- **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Designed for seamless integration with Kubernetes, Docker, and other cloud platforms.
- **Scheduling Capabilities**: Schedule and manage ETL tasks using built-in or external tools.
- **Framework Integrations**: Pre-built support for popular tools like Qdrant, Milvus, and Hugging Face.
- **Type Security**: By leveraging capabilities of [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and [pandera](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) we ensure type security

## Installation

To get started with wurzel, install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install wurzel
```


## Run a Step (Two Ways)

### 1. CLI-based Execution
Run a step using the CLI:
```bash
wurzel run <step_file_path> --inputs ./data --output ./out
```
To inspect the step requirements:
```bash
wurzel inspect wurzel.<step_path>
```
### 2. Programmatic Execution (Python)
Run a step using the snippet below:
```python
from wurzel.steps import step
from pathlib import Path
from wurzel.step_executor import BaseStepExecutor

with BaseStepExecutor() as ex:
    ex(step, set(Path("./input")), Path("./output"))
```

### Building your one step
