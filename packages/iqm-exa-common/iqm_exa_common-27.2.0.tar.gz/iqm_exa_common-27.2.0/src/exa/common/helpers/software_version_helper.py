def get_all_software_versions(reload_module: bool = False) -> dict[str, str]:
    """Get all available software version information.

    Currently, this function collects all Python package versions and Python interpreter version.

    Args:
        reload_module: Whether to reload the ``pkg_resources`` module or not. By default,
            it is disabled because reloading the module is not thread safe!
            This function should be called with ``reload_module=True`` when IPython autoreload is in use.

    Example:
            1. You have numpy==1.21.0 installed, and in the notebook you have executed the following IPython magic:

                .. code-block:: python

                    %load_ext autoreload
                    %autoreload 2

            2. You install numpy==1.21.1

            3. You call this function with ``reload_module=False``. This will result in some warning printouts and
               the function will succeed by returning 1.21.0 for numpy, which is wrong because in reality IPython
               autoreload has reloaded the newly installed numpy 1.21.1.
               With ``reload_module=True`` the correct version 1.21.1 is returned and no warnings are printed.


    Returns: All software components in a dictionary that maps each package name to its version
        information. A package's version information contains the base version, and the string
        "(local editable)" in the case the package is a local editable installation.

    The description is used to verify if a directory is installed under VCS and whether changes to the files have

    Only if it exists, a ``git`` command is executed in a subprocess with a timeout

            exa-experiment, it can be the exa-experiment root directory or any directory under it.

    Returns:
        If :attr:`root_directory` is not installed under git, None will be returned. Otherwise, the output of
        ``git describe --dirty --tags --long`` is returned. In case of errors in executing the command, the caught
        ``subprocess.CalledProcessError`` will be converted to string and returned.

    Raises:
