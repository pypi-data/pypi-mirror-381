"""
RepPrices ETL Load Module.

This module handles the loading phase of the RepPrices ETL pipeline.
It takes the transformed data and loads it into the target system, typically the
Nemo database or data warehouse.

The loading process typically includes:
1. Data validation before insertion
2. Connection management to target systems
3. Batch processing for efficient data loading
4. Error handling and rollback capabilities
5. Data integrity checks post-loading
6. Performance optimization for large datasets
7. Comprehensive logging throughout the process

Classes:
    RepPricesLoad: Main class handling RepPrices data loading.

    This class manages the loading phase of the RepPrices ETL pipeline,
    providing methods to insert transformed data into the target system with
    proper error handling, validation, and performance optimization.
    
    The loader:
    - Uses NemoLibrary for core functionality and configuration
    - Integrates with Prefect logging for pipeline visibility
    - Manages database connections and transactions
    - Provides batch processing capabilities
    - Handles data validation before insertion
    - Ensures data integrity and consistency
    - Optimizes performance for large datasets
    
    Attributes:
        nl (NemoLibrary): Core Nemo library instance for system integration.

        This method orchestrates the complete loading process by:
        1. Connecting to the target system (database, data warehouse, etc.)
        2. Loading transformed data from the previous ETL phase
        3. Validating data before insertion
        4. Performing batch inserts for optimal performance
        5. Handling errors and implementing rollback mechanisms
        6. Verifying data integrity post-insertion
        7. Updating metadata and audit tables
        8. Cleaning up temporary resources
        
        The method provides detailed logging for monitoring and debugging purposes
        and ensures transaction safety through proper error handling.
