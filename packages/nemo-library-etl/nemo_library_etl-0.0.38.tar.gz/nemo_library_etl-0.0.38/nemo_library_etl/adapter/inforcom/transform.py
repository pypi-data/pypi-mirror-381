"""
InforCOM ETL Transform Module.

This module handles the transformation phase of the InforCOM ETL pipeline.
It processes the extracted data, applies business rules, data cleaning, and formatting
to prepare the data for loading into the target system.

The transformation process typically includes:
1. Data validation and quality checks
2. Data type conversions and formatting
3. Business rule application
4. Data enrichment and calculated fields
5. Data structure normalization
6. Comprehensive logging throughout the process

Classes:
    InforCOMTransform: Main class handling InforCOM data transformation.

    Handles transformation of extracted InforCOM data.

    This class manages the transformation phase of the InforCOM ETL pipeline,
    providing methods to process, clean, and format the extracted data for loading
    into the target system.

    The transformer:
    - Uses NemoLibrary for core functionality and configuration
    - Integrates with Prefect logging for pipeline visibility
    - Applies business rules and data validation
    - Handles data type conversions and formatting
    - Provides data enrichment and calculated fields
    - Ensures data quality and consistency

    Attributes:
        nl (NemoLibrary): Core Nemo library instance for system integration.
        config: Configuration object from the Nemo library.
        logger: Prefect logger for pipeline execution tracking.

        Execute the main transformation process for InforCOM data.

        This method orchestrates the complete transformation process by:
        1. Loading extracted data from the previous ETL phase

        3. Performing data type conversions and formatting
        4. Applying business rules and logic
        5. Creating calculated fields and data enrichment
        6. Ensuring data consistency and integrity
        7. Preparing data for the loading phase

        The method provides detailed logging for monitoring and debugging purposes
        and handles errors gracefully to ensure pipeline stability.
