# What is it?

pyRugged is a python geolocation library used for satellite imagery (pyRugged is the python version of Rugged). It allows to map image coordinates (pixel, line) with geographic or projected
coordinates (lon, lat or x, y, h) by computing the intersection of the sensor's lines of sight with the Earth's terrain. This mapping is
essential for georeferencing raw satellite images. It is a key component when projecting an image on ground.

## Sensor-to-terrain mapping library


pyRugged provides the tools to model any type of sensors rigorously/physically, to process all the spacecraft navigation data
(position, velocity and attitude), and to take into account Digital
Elevation Models (DEM) to represent the surface of the Earth. It is on
this last point that Rugged gets its name from; Rugged deals with rugged
terrains.

pyRugged relies on [Orekit](https://https://www.orekit.org/) for all what concerns transformations between coordinate systems (inertial/terrestrial)
and orbital data but what pyRugged brings on top of Orekit, is the capacity
to deal with the DEM. Orekit could have been used for intersecting a line
of sight with the Earth's ellipsoid but it is not its mandate to know what
the Earth's surface looks like as it is a space dynamics library. It is in
this perspective that we decided to provide a separate package for those
users who look for a robust tool for geometric processing.

# Getting orekit jcc build

PyRugged relies on python wrapper for orekit build with JCC.

The project https://gitlab.eopf.copernicus.eu/geolib/orekit-jcc is aiming at providing tool to build orekit jcc packages.

Already build packages are available in https://gitlab.eopf.copernicus.eu/geolib/orekit-jcc/-/packages



# Who is behind it?

Rugged has been in development since 2014 inside [CS GROUP](https://www.csgroup.eu/) and is still used and maintained by its dual teams of space dynamics and image processing experts.
pyRugged, the python version of Rugged has been started in 2022.

Several major actors of space research and industry are interested into this project.

Rugged forum is available for any question or request about Rugged (see contact section).
