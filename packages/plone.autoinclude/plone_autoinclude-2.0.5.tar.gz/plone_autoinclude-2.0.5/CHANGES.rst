.. towncrier release notes start

2.0.5 (2025-10-02)
------------------

Tests:


- Fix tests with buildout 4, and add tests with buildout 5.
  This is needed because we get more namespace packages.
  [maurits]


2.0.4 (2025-09-10)
------------------

Internal:


- Build system: require ``setuptools  < 80``.  [maurits]


Tests:


- GitHub Actions: do not use a cache.  [maurits]
- Remove ``pkg_resources`` from tests.  [maurits]
- Test with latest ``zc.buildout`` 4.1.12, and run the buildout tests in GitHub Actions.
  [maurits]


2.0.3 (2025-03-14)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- Fix wheel compatibility with older versions of setuptools and buildout.
  [maurits] (#34)


2.0.2 (2025-03-12)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- If a distribution is not found, try to normalize the name like recent setuptools is doing and try again [ale-rt] (#32)


2.0.1 (2025-03-07)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- Replace ``pkg_resources`` with ``importlib.metadata``/``importlib.resources``.  [gforcada] (#4126)


2.0.0 (2025-02-27)
------------------

Breaking changes:


- Support Plone 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, Python 3.9-3.13, and Buildout 4.
  Drop support for older Plone, Python and Buildout versions.
  Drop support for PyPy.  Technically it may still work, but we no longer test it.  It is irrelevant for Plone.
  [maurits] (#24)


Bug fixes:


- Fix importing module when the module name differs from the project name.
  This can easily happen with ``setuptools`` 75.8.1, though maybe 75.8.2 fixes it in some cases.
  [maurits] (#25)


1.0.1 (2022-12-10)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- Revert "Use setuptools/pkg_resources regex to compute safe name for a project" to fix an error importing packages with dashes. [davisagli] (#22)


1.0.0 (2022-12-01)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- Use setuptools/pkg_resources regex to compute safe name for a project.
  [gforcada] (#17)


1.0.0a5 (2022-05-24)
--------------------

New features:


- Raise an exception when a module is not found.
  When environment variable ``AUTOINCLUDE_ALLOW_MODULE_NOT_FOUND_ERROR=1`` is set, we log an error and continue.
  To accept ``ModuleNotFoundError`` only in specific packages, use a comma-separated list of project names, with or without spaces.
  See `issue 19 <https://github.com/plone/plone.autoinclude/issues/19>`_.
  [maurits] (#19)


1.0.0a4 (2022-02-23)
--------------------

- Replace dash with lowdash in project_name, as Python Project are normally divided by dash and modul name uses lowdash [MrTango] (#16)


1.0.0a3 (2021-12-03)
--------------------

Bug fixes:


- Decrease verbosity when loading packages (#11)


1.0.0a2 (2021-10-20)

  Added zcml in a ploneinclude directory to make this easier for now.
  [maurits] (#1)


1.0.0a1 (2021-10-15)
--------------------

New features:

- Initial release.
