"""
A fake P4 module to use in tests.

Provides a `P4` class that mimics the real `P4.P4` interface minimally:
- run(cmd, *args) -> delegates to fake_run
- fake_run(cmd, *args) -> returns canned responses or raises for unknown commands
- register_response(cmd, response) -> register a value or callable to produce responses
- __getattr__ to allow attribute-style access on the P4 object

Usage in tests:
    from tests import fake_p4
    fake = fake_p4.P4()
    fake.register_response('login', lambda *a: {'status': 'ok'})
    monkeypatch.setattr('P4', fake_p4)  # or patch where your code imports P4

The module exposes module-level attribute `P4` so code that does `from P4 import P4` can be patched to use this.
