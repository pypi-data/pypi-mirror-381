## About

`idc-index` is a Python package that enables basic operations for working with
[NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov):

- subsetting of the IDC data using selected metadata attributes
- download of the files corresponding to selection
- generation of the viewer URLs for the selected data

## Getting started

Install the latest version of the package.

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade idc-index
```

Instantiate `IDCClient`, which provides the interface for main operations.

```python
from idc_index import IDCClient

client = IDCClient.client()
```

You can use [IDC Portal](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/explore/) to
browse collections, cases, studies and series, copy their identifiers and
download the corresponding files using `idc-index` helper functions.

You can try this out with the `rider_pilot` collection, which is just 10.5 GB in
size:

```
client.download_from_selection(collection_id="rider_pilot", downloadDir=".")
```

... or run queries against the "mini" index of Imaging Data Commons data, and
download images that match your selection criteria! The following will select
all Magnetic Resonance (MR) series, and will download the first 10.

```python
from idc_index import index

client = index.IDCClient()

query = """
SELECT
  SeriesInstanceUID
FROM
  index
WHERE
  Modality = 'MR'
"""

selection_df = client.sql_query(query)

client.download_from_selection(
    seriesInstanceUID=list(selection_df["SeriesInstanceUID"].values[:10]),
    downloadDir=".",
)
```

## Tutorial

Please check out
[this tutorial notebook](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Tutorials/blob/master/notebooks/labs/idc_rsna2023.ipynb)
for the introduction into using `idc-index`.

## Resources

- [Imaging Data Commons Portal](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/) can be
  used to explore the content of IDC from the web browser
- [s5cmd](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd) is a highly efficient, open source,
  multi-platform S3 client that we use for downloading IDC data, which is hosted
  in public AWS and GCS buckets. Distributed on PyPI as
  [s5cmd](https://pypi.org/project/s5cmd/).
- [SlicerIDCBrowser](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/SlicerIDCBrowser) 3D
  Slicer extension that relies on `idc-index` for search and download of IDC
  data
