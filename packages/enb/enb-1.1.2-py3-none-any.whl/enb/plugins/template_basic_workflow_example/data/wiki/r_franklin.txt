==Education and early life==
Franklin was born on 25 July 1920 in 50 Chepstow Villas,<ref>{{cite web |title=Name of Firm: A.

Rosalind was the elder daughter and the second child in the family of five children. David (born 1919) was the eldest brother; [[Colin Franklin (bibliographer)|Colin]] (1923-2020), [[Roland Franklin|Roland]] (born 1926), and Jenifer (born 1929) were her younger siblings.<ref name="Glynn, p.1">Glynn, p. 1.</ref> Her father's uncle was [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] (later Viscount Samuel), who was the [[Home Secretary]] in 1916 and the first practising Jew to serve in the [[British Cabinet]].<ref name="Samuel">Maddox, p. 7.</ref> Her aunt, Helen Caroline Franklin, known in the family as Mamie, was married to [[Norman de Mattos Bentwich]], who was the [[Attorney General]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]].<ref>Segev p.</ref> Helen Caroline Franklin was active in [[trade union]] organisation and the [[women's suffrage movement]], and was later a member of the [[London County Council]].<ref name="p31">{{cite book |last=Sayre |first=A. |title=Rosalind Franklin and DNA |year=1975 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-07493-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/rosalindfranklin00anne/page/31 31] |url=https://archive.org/details/rosalindfranklin00anne/page/31 }}</ref><ref name="p40">Maddox, p. 40.</ref> Her uncle, [[Hugh Franklin (suffragist)|Hugh Franklin]], was another prominent figure in the suffrage movement, although his actions therein embarrassed the Franklin family.

From early childhood, Franklin showed exceptional scholastic abilities. At age six, she joined her brother Roland at [[Norland Place School]], a private day school in West London. At that time, her aunt Mamie (Helen Bentwich), described her to her husband: "Rosalind is alarmingly clever – she spends all her time doing arithmetic for pleasure, and invariably gets her sums right."<ref>Maddox, p. 15.</ref> She also developed an early interest in cricket and hockey. At age nine, she entered a boarding school, Lindores School for Young Ladies in Sussex.<ref name=berger>{{cite web |last1=Berger |first1=Doreen |title=A Biography of The Dark Lady Of Notting Hill |url=http://www.theus.org.uk/article/biography-dark-lady-notting-hill |publisher=United Synagogue Women |accessdate=7 February 2015 |date=3 December 2014}}</ref> The school was near the seaside, and the family wanted a good environment for her delicate health.

===Cambridge and World War II===
Franklin went to [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] in 1938 and studied chemistry within the [[Natural Sciences Tripos]]. There she met the spectroscopist [[Bill Price (physicist)|Bill Price]], who worked with her as a laboratory demonstrator and who later became one of her senior colleagues at King's College London.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dixon |first1=R.

The distinction was accepted as a bachelor's degree in qualifications for employment. Cambridge began awarding titular [[B.A.]] and [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] degrees to women from 1947, and the previous women graduates retroactively received these.<ref>''Fact sheet: Women at Cambridge: A Chronology'', [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114162700/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html|date=14 January 2012}}</ref> In her last year at Cambridge, she met a French refugee Adrienne Weill, a former student of [[Marie Curie]], who had a huge influence on her life and career and helped her to improve her spoken French.<ref>Polcovar, p. 31.</ref><ref>Williams, p. 279</ref>

Franklin was awarded a research fellowship at Newnham College, with which she joined the physical chemistry laboratory of the [[University of Cambridge]] to work under [[Ronald George Wreyford Norrish]], who later won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. In her one year of work there, she did not have much success.<ref>''Rosalind Franklin'', Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's Dolan DNA Learning Center, ID 1649, [http://www.dnalc.org/view/16049-Rosalind-Franklin-.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903045728/https://www.dnalc.org/view/16049-Rosalind-Franklin-.html |date=3 September 2018 }}.</ref> As described by his biographer, Norrish was "obstinate and almost perverse in argument, overbearing and sensitive to criticism".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Ronald George Wreyford Norrish, 9 November 1897 – 7 June 1978 |last1=Dainton |first1=Sir Frederick Sydney |journal=[[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] |year=1981 |volume=27 |pages=379–424 |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1981.0016 |jstor=769878|s2cid=72584163 }}</ref> He could not decide for her what to work upon, and at that time was succumbing to heavy drinking.

Norrish acted as advisor to the military at BCURA. [[John G. Bennett]] was the director. [[Marcello Pirani]] and [[Victor Goldschmidt]], both refugees from the Nazis, were consultants and lectured at BCURA while Franklin worked there.<ref name="nlm-coal" /> During her BCURA research, she stayed at Adrienne Weill's boarding house in Cambridge until her cousin Irene Franklin asked to join her in a vacated house of her uncle in [[Putney]]. With Irene, she volunteered as an [[Air Raid Warden]] and regularly made patrols to see the welfare of people during air raids.<ref>Polcovar, p. 37.</ref>

She studied the [[porosity]] of coal using helium to determine its density.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=P.J.F. |title=Rosalind Franklin's work on coal, carbon, and graphite |journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews |date=March 2001 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=204–210 |doi=10.1179/030801801679467 |s2cid=269381 |url=http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~scsharip/REF_paper.pdf}}</ref> Through this, she discovered the relationship between the fine constrictions in the pores of coals and the permeability of the porous space.

==Career and research==
Franklin spent her career working in London and Paris.

===Paris===
With World War II ending in 1945, Franklin asked Adrienne Weill for help and to let her know of job openings for "a physical chemist who knows very little physical chemistry, but quite a lot about the holes in coal". At a conference in the autumn of 1946, Weill introduced her to Marcel Mathieu, a director of the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS), the network of institutes that comprise the major part of the scientific research laboratories supported by the French government. This led to her appointment with [[Jacques Mering]] at the Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'État in Paris. She joined the ''labo'' (as referred to by the staff) of Mering on 14 February 1947 as one of the fifteen ''chercheurs'' (researchers).<ref>{{cite web |title=Rosalind Franklin |url=http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/rosalind-franklin-8b1475bf-3c20-4e45-8b71-e0fb9a014e5c |work=Timetoast |accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rosalind Franklin (1920–1958) |url=http://www.dnaftb.org/19/bio-3.html |publisher=DNA Learning Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory |accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref>

Mering was an X-ray crystallographer who applied [[X-ray diffraction]] to the study of rayon and other amorphous substances, in contrast to the thousands of regular crystals that had been studied by this method for many years.<ref name="nlm-coal" /> He taught her the practical aspects of applying X-ray crystallography to amorphous substances. This presented new challenges in the conduct of experiments and the interpretation of results. Franklin applied them to further problems related to coal and to other carbonaceous materials, in particular the changes to the arrangement of atoms when these are converted to graphite.<ref name="nlm-coal" /> She published several further papers on this work which has become part of the mainstream of the physics and chemistry of coal and carbon. She coined the terms [[Graphitizing and non-graphitizing carbons|graphitising and non-graphitising carbon]]. The coal work was covered in a 1993 monograph,<ref>D. W. van Krevelen, ''Coal, Third Edition: Typology – Physics – Chemistry – Constitution'', Elsevier, New York, 1993.</ref> and in the regularly-published textbook ''Chemistry and Physics of Carbon''.<ref>''Chemistry and Physics of Carbon'', vol 1–, 1968–, Elsevier, New York.</ref> Mering continued the study of carbon in various forms, using X-ray diffraction and other methods.<ref>G. Terriere, A. Oberlin, J. Mering, ''Oxidation of graphite in liquid medium – observations by means of microscopy and electron diffraction'', Carbon, 5, 431--, 1967.</ref>

===King's College London===
{{Single strand DNA discovery}}

In 1950, Franklin was granted a three-year [[Turner & Newall]] Fellowship to work at [[King's College London]]. In January 1951, she started working as a research associate in the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council's]] (MRC) Biophysics Unit, directed by [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]].<ref>Maddox, p. 124.</ref> She was originally appointed to work on X-ray diffraction of [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s in solution, but Randall redirected her work to DNA fibres<ref>Williams, p. 282.</ref> because of new developments in the field, and she was to be the only experienced experimental diffraction researcher at King's at the time.<ref>Maddox, p. 114.</ref><ref>Wilkins, Wilkins, M., The Third Man of the Double Helix, an autobiography (2003) Oxford University Press, Oxford. pp. 143–144.</ref> Randall made this reassignment, even before Franklin started working at King's, because of the pioneering work by DNA researcher [[Maurice Wilkins]], and he reassigned [[Raymond Gosling]], the graduate student who had been working with Wilkins, to be her assistant.<ref>Wilkins, p. 121.</ref>

Even using crude equipment, Wilkins and Gosling had obtained an outstanding diffraction picture of DNA which sparked further interest in this molecule.<ref name="Gosling_obit">"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11624246/Professor-Raymond-Gosling-DNA-scientist-obituary.html Professor Raymond Gosling, DNA scientist – obituary]", ''The Telegraph,'' 22 May 2015. Retrieved 3 September 2019.</ref> They had been carrying out [[X-ray]] diffraction analysis of DNA in the unit since May 1950, but Randall had not informed them that he had asked Franklin to take over both the DNA diffraction work and guidance of Gosling's thesis.<ref>Maddox, pp. 149–150, Elkin, p 45. Elkin, L.O. Rosalind Franklin and the Double Helix. Physics Today, March 2003(available free on-line, see references). Olby, R. ''The Path to the Double Helix'' (London: Macmillan, 1974).</ref> Randall's lack of communication about this reassignment significantly contributed to the well documented friction that developed between Wilkins and Franklin.<ref>Sayre, Olby, Maddox, Elkin, Wilkins.</ref>

Franklin, now working with Gosling,<ref>Maddox, p. 129.</ref> started to apply her expertise in X-ray diffraction techniques to the structure of DNA. She used a new fine-focus X-ray tube and microcamera ordered by Wilkins, but which she refined, adjusted and focused carefully. Drawing upon her physical chemistry background, she also skillfully manipulated the critical hydration of her specimens.<ref>Elkin, p. 43.</ref> When Wilkins inquired about this improved technique, she replied in terms which offended Wilkins as Franklin had "an air of cool superiority".<ref>Wilkins, p. 155.</ref>

Franklin presented their data at a lecture in November 1951, in King's College London. In her lecture notes, Franklin wrote the following:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sayre |first1=Anne |title=Rosalind Franklin and DNA |date=2000 |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=0-393-32044-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgqFuy4LGb0C&dq=Rosalind+Franklin+and+DNA |ref=Sayre}}</ref>
{{quote|"The results suggest a helical structure (which must be very closely packed) containing 2, 3 or 4 co‐axial nucleic acid chains per helical unit, and having the phosphate groups near the outside."}}

Franklin's habit of intensely looking people in the eye while being concise, impatient and direct unnerved many of her colleagues. In stark contrast, Wilkins was very shy, and slowly calculating in speech while he avoided looking anyone directly in the eye.<ref name="Elkin 45">Elkin p. 45.</ref> In spite of the intense atmosphere, Franklin and Gosling discovered that there were two forms of DNA: at high humidity (when wet) the DNA fibre became long and thin; when it was dried it became short and fat.<ref name="Maddox, p. 153">Maddox, p. 153.</ref><ref>Wilkins, p. 154.</ref>

Franklin named these two forms "[[B-DNA|B]]" and "[[A-DNA|A]]" respectively. (The biological functions of A-DNA were only discovered 60 years later.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Bayden R. |title=The importance of hydration and DNA conformation in interpreting infrared spectra of cells and tissues |journal=Chemical Society Reviews |date=2016 |volume= 45|issue=7 |doi=10.1039/C5CS00511F |pmid=26403652 |pages=1980–98|s2cid=24571043 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/06421b4b582c2a7aee10975baf94e15e7dcc2ae6 }}</ref>) Because of the intense personality conflict developing between Franklin and Wilkins, Randall<ref name="Maddox 155">Maddox, p. 155.</ref> divided the work on DNA. Franklin chose the data rich "A" form while Wilkins selected the "B" form<ref name="Maddox 155"/><ref name="Wilkins, p. 158">Wilkins, p. 158.</ref> because, according to his autobiography, Wilkins' preliminary pictures had hinted it might be [[helix|helical]]. The X-ray diffraction pictures, including the landmark ''[[Photo 51]]'' taken by Franklin's student  Gosling at this time,<ref name="Gosling_obit" /> have been called by [[John Desmond Bernal]] as "amongst the most beautiful X-ray photographs of any substance ever taken".<ref name="Maddox, p. 153"/>

By the end of 1951 it was generally accepted at King's that the B form of DNA was a [[helix]], but after she had recorded an asymmetrical image in May 1952, Franklin became unconvinced that the A form of DNA was a helix.<ref name="Wilkins, p. 176">Wilkins, p. 176.</ref> In July 1952, as a practical joke on Wilkins (who frequently expressed his view that both forms of DNA were helical), Franklin and Gosling produced a funeral notice regretting the 'death' of helical crystalline DNA (A-DNA).<ref>Wilkins, p. 182.</ref> During 1952, they worked at applying the [[Patterson function]] to the X-ray pictures of DNA they had produced.<ref>Maddox, p. 168.</ref> This was a long and labour-intensive approach but would yield significant insight into the structure of the molecule.<ref>Maddox, p. 169.</ref><ref>Wilkins, pp. 232–233.</ref>

By January 1953, Franklin had reconciled her conflicting data, concluding that both DNA forms had two helices, and had started to write a series of three draft manuscripts, two of which included a double helical DNA backbone (see below). Her two A-DNA manuscripts reached ''[[Acta Crystallographica]]'' in [[Copenhagen]] on 6 March 1953, one day before Crick and Watson had completed their model on B-DNA.

The third draft paper was on the B form of DNA, dated 17 March 1953, which was discovered years later amongst her papers,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://search.wellcomelibrary.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1983228?lang=eng |title=Wellcome Library Encore – [The Papers of Rosalind Franklin] [archive material] |website=search.wellcomelibrary.org |access-date=11 October 2016}}</ref> by Franklin's Birkbeck colleague, [[Aaron Klug]]. He then published an evaluation of the draft's close correlation with the third of the original trio of 25 April 1953 ''Nature'' DNA articles.<ref>Klug, A., "Rosalind Franklin and the Double Helix", ''Nature'' 248 (26 April 1974): 787–788.</ref> Klug designed this paper to complement the first article he had written defending Franklin's significant contribution to DNA structure.<ref>Klug, A., Rosalind Franklin and the Discovery of the Structure of DNA, ''Nature'' 219 (24 August 1968): 808–810 & 843.</ref> He had written this first article in response to the incomplete picture of Franklin's work depicted in Watson's 1968 memoir, ''[[The Double Helix]]''.

As vividly described in ''The Double Helix'', on 30 January 1953, Watson travelled to King's carrying a preprint of [[Linus Pauling]]'s incorrect proposal for DNA structure. Since Wilkins was not in his office, Watson went to Franklin's lab with his urgent message that they should all collaborate before Pauling discovered his error. The unimpressed Franklin became angry when Watson suggested she did not know how to interpret her own data. Watson hastily retreated, backing into Wilkins who had been attracted by the commotion. Wilkins commiserated with his harried friend and then showed Watson Franklin's DNA X-ray image.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hubbard |first1=Ruth |title=Women, Science, and Technology |date=2013 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |location=Hoboken |isbn=978-1-135-05542-4 |page=269 |edition=3rd |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unO_AAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA269&dq=Wilkins%20Watson%20Franklin%20X-ray&pg=PA269#v=onepage |chapter=Science, Power, Gender: How DNA Became the Book of Life}}</ref> Watson, in turn, showed Wilkins a prepublication manuscript by Pauling and Corey, which contained a DNA structure remarkably like their first incorrect model.<ref>Yockey, pp. 9–10.</ref>

====DNA research====
In February 1953, [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in [[Cambridge University]] had started to build a [[molecular model]] of the B form of DNA using data similar to that available to both teams at King's. Much of their data was derived directly from research done at King's by Wilkins and Franklin. Franklin's research was completed by February 1953, ahead of her move to Birkbeck, and her data was critical.<ref>Crick's 31 December 1961 letter to Jacque Monod cited above.</ref> Model building had been applied successfully in the elucidation of the structure of the [[alpha helix]] by Linus Pauling in 1951,<ref name="Wilkins, p. 158" /><ref>Maddox, p. 147.</ref> but Franklin was opposed to prematurely building theoretical models, until sufficient data were obtained to properly guide the model building. She took the view that building a model was to be undertaken only after enough of the structure was known.<ref name="Wilkins, p. 176" /><ref>Maddox, p. 161.</ref>

Ever cautious, she wanted to eliminate misleading possibilities. Photographs of her Birkbeck work table show that she routinely used small molecular models, although certainly not ones on the grand scale successfully used at Cambridge for DNA. In the middle of February 1953, Crick's thesis advisor, [[Max Perutz]], gave Crick a copy of a report written for a [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952, containing many of Franklin's crystallographic calculations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=Ruth |title=The Politics of Women's Biology |date=1990 |publisher=Rutgers State University |isbn=0-8135-1490-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/politicsofwomens00hubb/page/60 60] |url=https://archive.org/details/politicsofwomens00hubb/page/60 }}</ref>

Since Franklin had decided to transfer to Birkbeck College and Randall had insisted that all DNA work must stay at King's, Wilkins was given copies of Franklin's diffraction photographs by Gosling. By 28 February 1953, Watson and Crick felt they had solved the problem enough for Crick to proclaim (in the local pub) that they had "found the secret of life".<ref>"The Double Helix", p. 115.</ref> However, they knew they must complete their model before they could be certain.<ref>"The Double Helix", p. 60.</ref>

Watson and Crick finished building their model on 7 March 1953, one day before they received a letter from Wilkins stating that Franklin was finally leaving and they could put "all hands to the pump".<ref>"All hands to the pump" letter is preserved in the Crick archives at the University of California, San Diego, and was posted as part of their Web collection. It is also quoted by both Maddox, p 204, and Olby.</ref> This was also one day after Franklin's two A-DNA papers had reached ''Acta Crystallographica''. Wilkins came to see the model the following week, according to Franklin's biographer [[Brenda Maddox]] on 12 March, and allegedly informed Gosling on his return to King's.<ref name="Maddox 207">Maddox, p. 207.</ref>

It is uncertain how long it took for Gosling to inform Franklin at Birkbeck, but her original 17 March B-DNA manuscript does not reflect any knowledge of the Cambridge model. Franklin did modify this draft later before publishing it as the third in the trio of 25 April 1953 ''Nature'' articles. On 18 March,<ref>In contrast to his other letters to Crick, Wilkins dated this one.</ref> in response to receiving a copy of their preliminary manuscript, Wilkins penned the following: "I think you're a couple of old rogues, but you may well have something".<ref>"Old rogues" letter is preserved in the Crick archives at the University of California at San Diego, and was posted as part of their web collection. It is also quoted by both Maddox, p. 208, and Olby.</ref>

Weeks later, on 10 April, Franklin wrote to Crick for permission to see their model.<ref>10 April 1953, Franklin postcard to Crick asking permission to view model. The original is in the Crick archives at the University of California, San Diego.</ref> Franklin retained her scepticism for premature model building even after seeing the Watson–Crick model, and remained unimpressed. She is reported to have commented, "It's very pretty, but how are they going to prove it?" As an experimental scientist, Franklin seems to have been interested in producing far greater evidence before publishing-as-proven a proposed model. As such, her response to the Watson–Crick model was in keeping with her cautious approach to science.<ref>Holt, J. (2002).</ref>

Crick and Watson then published their model in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 25 April 1953, in an article describing the double-helical structure of DNA with only a footnote acknowledging "having been stimulated by a general knowledge of" Franklin and Wilkins' "unpublished" contribution.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite journal |authors=Watson, J.

===Birkbeck College===
[[File:TMV virus under magnification.jpg|right|thumb|An [[Micrograph#Electron micrograph|electron micrograph]] of [[tobacco mosaic virus]]]]

Franklin left King's College London in mid-March 1953 for [[Birkbeck College]], in a move that had been planned for some time and that she described (in a letter to Adrienne Weill in Paris) as "moving from a palace to the slums&nbsp;... but pleasanter all the same".<ref>Maddox, p. 205.</ref> She was recruited by physics department chair John Desmond Bernal,<ref>Maddox, p. 229.</ref> a crystallographer who was a communist, known for promoting women crystallographers. Her new laboratories were housed in 21 Torrington Square, one of a pair of dilapidated and cramped Georgian houses containing several different departments; Franklin frequently took Bernal to task over the careless attitudes of some of the other laboratory staff, notably after workers in the pharmacy department flooded her first-floor laboratory with water on one occasion.<ref>Brown, Andrew, ''J. D. Bernal, the sage of science'' (2005), Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp. 353–355.</ref>

Despite the parting words of Bernal to stop her interest in nucleic acids, she helped Gosling to finish his thesis, although she was no longer his official supervisor. Together they published the first evidence of double helix in the A form of DNA in the 25 July issue of ''Nature''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Franklin |first1=RE |last2=Gosling |first2=RG |title=Evidence for 2-chain helix in crystalline structure of sodium deoxyribonucleate. |journal=Nature |date=1953 |volume=172 |issue=4369 |pages=156–157 |doi=10.1038/172156a0 |pmid=13072614 |bibcode=1953Natur.172..156F|s2cid=4169572 }}</ref> At the end of 1954, Bernal secured funding for Franklin from the [[Agricultural Research Council]] (ARC), which enabled her to work as a senior scientist supervising her own research group.<ref>Maddox, p. 235.</ref><ref name="Brown, pp. 356–357">Brown, pp. 356–357.</ref> [[John Thomas Finch|John Finch]], a physics student from [[King's College London]], subsequently joined Franklin's group, followed by [[Kenneth Holmes]], a Cambridge graduate, in July 1955. Despite the ARC funding, Franklin wrote to Bernal that the existing facilities remained highly unsuited for conducting research "...my desk and lab are on the fourth floor, my X-ray tube in the basement, and I am responsible for the work of four people distributed over the basement, first and second floors on two different staircases."<ref name="Brown, pp. 356–357"/>

====RNA research====
Franklin continued to explore another major nucleic acid, [[RNA]], a molecule equally central to life as [[DNA]]. She again used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV), an [[RNA virus]]. Her meeting with Aaron Klug in early 1954 led to a longstanding and successful collaboration. Klug had just then earned his PhD from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and joined Birkbeck in late 1953. In 1955 Franklin published her first major works on TMV in ''Nature'', in which she described that all TMV virus particles were of the same length.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Franklin |first1=RE. |title=Structure of Tobacco Mosaic Virus |journal=Nature |year=1955 |volume=175 |issue=4452 |pages=379–381 |doi=10.1038/175379a0 |pmid=14356181 |bibcode=1955Natur.175..379F|s2cid=1109700 }}</ref> This was in direct contradiction to the ideas of the eminent virologist [[Norman Pirie]], though her observation ultimately proved correct.<ref>Maddox, p. 252.</ref>

Franklin assigned the study of the complete structure of TMV to her PhD student Holmes. They soon discovered (published in 1956) that the covering of TMV was protein molecules arranged in helices.<ref>Franklin and Holmes, 1956.</ref> Her colleague Klug worked on spherical viruses with his student Finch, with Franklin coordinating and overseeing the work.<ref>Maddox, p. 254.</ref> As a team, from 1956 they started publishing seminal works on TMV,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Franklin |first1=Rosalind E. |last2=Klug |first2=A. |title=The nature of the helical groove on the tobacco mosaic virus particle X-ray diffraction studies |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |date=1956 |volume=19 |pages=403–416 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(56)90463-2 |pmid=13315300 |issue=3}}</ref> cucumber virus 4 and [[turnip yellow mosaic virus]].<ref>Franklin ''et al.'', 1958.</ref>

Franklin also had a [[research assistant]], James Watt, subsidised by the [[National Coal Board]] and was now the leader of the ARC group at Birkbeck.<ref>Maddox, p. 256.</ref> The Birkbeck team members continued working on RNA viruses affecting several plants, including potato, turnip, tomato and pea.<ref>Maddox, p. 262.</ref> In 1955 the team was joined by an American post-doctoral student [[Donald Caspar]]. He worked on the precise location of RNA molecules in TMV. In 1956 he and Franklin published individual but complementary papers in the 10 March issue of ''Nature'', in which they showed that the RNA in TMV is wound along the inner surface of the hollow virus.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Franklin |first1=RE |title=Structure of Tobacco Mosaic Virus: Location of the Ribonucleic Acid in the Tobacco Mosaic Virus Particle |journal=Nature |year=1956 |volume=177 |issue=4516 |pages=928–930 |doi=10.1038/177928b0 |bibcode=1956Natur.177..928F|s2cid=4167638 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Casper |first1=D.

In 1957 her research grant from ARC expired, and was given a one-year extension ending in March 1958.

[[Expo 58]], the first major international fair after World War II, was to be held in Brussels in 1958.<ref>{{cite web |title=Expo 58 |url=http://users.skynet.be/rentfarm/expo58/ |accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Devos |first1=Rika |title=Expo 58: the catalyst for Belgium's Welfare State Government complex? |journal=Planning Perspectives |year=2011 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=649–659 |doi=10.1080/02665433.2011.599934|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/1013792/file/6742349.pdf |hdl=1854/LU-1013792 |s2cid=144066750 }}</ref> Franklin was invited to make a five-foot high model of TMV, which she started in 1957.

====Polio virus====

In 1956, Franklin visited the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where colleagues had suggested her group research the [[Poliovirus|polio virus]].<ref>Brown, pp. 358–359.</ref> In 1957 she applied for a grant from the United States [[Public Health Service]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]], which approved £10,000 for three years, the largest fund ever received at Birkbeck.<ref>Maddox, p. 296.</ref><ref>Glynn, p. 145.</ref> In her grant application, Franklin mentioned her new interest in animal virus research.  She obtained Bernal's consent in July 1957, though serious concerns were raised after she disclosed her intentions to research live, instead of killed, polio virus at Birkbeck. Eventually, Bernal arranged for the virus to be safely stored at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] during the group's research. With her group, Franklin then commenced deciphering the structure of the polio virus while it was in a crystalline state. She attempted to mount the virus crystals in capillary tubes for X-ray studies, but was forced to end her work due to her rapidly failing health.<ref>Brown, p. 359.</ref>

After Franklin's death, [[Aaron Klug|Klug]] succeeded her as group leader, and he, Finch and Holmes continued researching the structure of the polio virus. They eventually succeeded in obtaining extremely detailed X-ray images of the virus. In June 1959, Klug and Finch published the group's findings, revealing the polio virus to have icosahedral symmetry, and in the same paper suggested the possibility for all spherical viruses to possess the same symmetry, as it permitted the greatest possible number (60) of identical structural units.<ref>Brown, pp. 360–361.</ref> The team moved to the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]], Cambridge in 1962,<ref>Glynn, p. 153.</ref> and the old Torrington Square laboratories were demolished four years later, in May 1966.<ref>Brown, p. 466.</ref>

==Personal life==
Franklin was best described as an [[agnostic]]. Her lack of religious faith apparently did not stem from anyone's influence, rather from her own line of thinking. She developed her scepticism as a young child. Her mother recalled that she refused to believe in the [[existence of God]], and remarked, "Well, anyhow, how do you know He isn't She?"<ref>Glynn, p. 12.</ref> She later made her position clear, now based on her scientific experience, and wrote to her father in 1940:
{{quote|[S]cience and everyday life cannot and should not be separated. Science, for me, gives a partial explanation of life&nbsp;... I do not accept your definition of faith i.e. belief in life after death&nbsp;... Your faith rests on the future of yourself and others as individuals, mine in the future and fate of our successors. It seems to me that yours is the more selfish&nbsp;...<ref>Glynn, p. 62.</ref> [as to] the question of a creator. A creator of what?&nbsp;... I see no reason to believe that a creator of protoplasm or primeval matter, if such there be, has any reason to be interested in our insignificant race in a tiny corner of the universe.<ref name="Maddox, p. 61">Maddox, p. 61.</ref>}}

However, she did not abandon Jewish traditions. As the only Jewish student at Lindores School, she had Hebrew lessons on her own while her friends went to church.<ref>Glynn, p. 19.</ref> She joined the Jewish Society while in her first term at Newnham College, Cambridge, out of respect of her grandfather's request.<ref>Glynn, p. 44.</ref> Franklin confided to her sister that she was "always consciously a Jew".<ref name="Maddox, p. 61"/>

Franklin loved travelling abroad, particularly [[trekking]]. She first "qualified" at Christmas 1929 for a vacation at [[Menton]], France, where her grandfather went to escape the English winter.<ref>Glynn, p. 16.</ref> Her family frequently spent vacations in Wales or Cornwall. A trip to France in 1938 gave her a lasting love for France and its language. She considered the French lifestyle at that time as "vastly superior to that of English".<ref name="Polcovar, p. 33">Polcovar, p. 33.</ref> In contrast, she described English people as having "vacant stupid faces and childlike complacency".<ref>Polcovar, p. 59.</ref> Her family was almost stuck in Norway in 1939, as World War II was declared on their way home.<ref>Glynn, p. 33.</ref> In another instance, she trekked the French Alps with Jean Kerslake in 1946, which almost cost her her life. She slipped off on a slope, and was barely rescued.<ref>Glynn, p. 79.</ref> But she wrote to her mother, "I am quite sure I could wander happily in France forever. I love the people, the country and the food."<ref name="Polcovar, p. 41">Polcovar, p. 41.</ref>

She made several professional trips to the United States, and was particularly jovial among her American friends and constantly displayed her sense of humour. William Ginoza of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] later recalled that she was the opposite of Watson's description of her, and as Maddox comments, Americans enjoyed her "sunny side".<ref>Maddox, p. 277.</ref>

In his book ''The Double Helix,'' Watson provides his first-person account of the search for and discovery of DNA. He paints a sympathetic but sometimes critical portrait of Franklin. He praises her intellect and scientific acumen, but portrays her as difficult to work with and careless with her appearance. After introducing her in the book as "Rosalind", he writes that he and his male colleagues usually referred to her as "Rosy", the name people at King's College London used behind her back.<ref>Watson, p. 16.</ref> She did not want to be called by that name because she had a great-aunt Rosy. In the family, she was called "Ros".<ref>Glynn, p. 157.</ref> To others, she was simply "Rosalind". She made it clear to an American visiting friend Dorothea Raacke, while sitting with her at Crick's table in [[The Eagle, Cambridge|The Eagle]] pub in Cambridge: Raacke asked her how she was to be called and she replied "I'm afraid it will have to be Rosalind", adding "Most definitely not ''Rosy''."<ref name="Maddox, p. 288">Maddox, p. 288.</ref>

She often expressed her political views. She initially blamed [[Winston Churchill]] for inciting the war, but later admired him for his speeches. She actively supported Professor [[John Ryle (physician)|John Ryle]] as an independent candidate for parliament in 1940, but he was unsuccessful.<ref name="Glynn, p. 52">Glynn, p. 52.</ref>

She did not seem to have an intimate relationship with anyone, and always kept her deepest personal feelings to herself. After her younger days, she avoided close friendship with the opposite sex. In her later years, Evi Ellis, who had shared her bedroom when a child refugee and who was then married to Ernst Wohlgemuth<ref name=genealogy/> and had moved to Notting Hill from Chicago, tried matchmaking her with [[Ralph Miliband]] but failed. Franklin once told Evi that her flatmate asked her for a drink, but she did not understand the intention.<ref>Maddox, p. 261.</ref> She was quite infatuated by her French mentor Mering, who had a wife and a mistress.<ref name="Polcovar, p. 41"/> Mering also admitted that he was captivated by her "intelligence and beauty".<ref>Polcovar, p. 51.</ref> According to [[Anne Sayre]], Franklin did confess her feeling for Mering when she was undergoing surgery, but her family denied this{{when|date=February 2020}}. Mering wept when he visited her later,<ref name="Glynn, p. 52"/> and destroyed all her letters.{{when|date=February 2020}}<ref>Maddox, p. 287.</ref>

Her closest personal affair was probably with her once post-doctoral student [[Donald Caspar]]. In 1956, she visited him at his home in Colorado after her tour to [[University of California, Berkeley]], and she was known to remark later that Caspar was one "she might have loved, might have married". In her letter to Sayre, she described him as "an ideal match".<ref>Maddox, p. 283.</ref>

===Illness, death and burial===
In mid-1956, while on a work-related trip to the United States, Franklin first began to suspect a health problem. While in New York she found difficulty in zipping her skirt; her stomach had bulged. Back in London she consulted Mair Livingstone, who asked her, "You're not pregnant?" to which she retorted, "I wish I were." Her case was marked "URGENT".<ref>Maddox, p. 284.</ref> An operation on 4 September of the same year revealed two tumours in her abdomen.<ref>Maddox, p. 285.</ref> After this period and other periods of hospitalisation, Franklin spent time convalescing with various friends and family members. These included Anne Sayre, Francis Crick, his wife Odile, with whom Franklin had formed a strong friendship,<ref name="Maddox, p. 288"/> and finally with the Roland and Nina Franklin family where Rosalind's nieces and nephews bolstered her spirits.

Franklin chose not to stay with her parents because her mother's uncontrollable grief and crying upset her too much. Even while undergoing cancer treatment, Franklin continued to work, and her group continued to produce results – seven papers in 1956 and six more in 1957.<ref>Maddox, p. 292.</ref> At the end of 1957, Franklin again fell ill and she was admitted to the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]]. On 2 December, she made her will. She named her three brothers as executors and made her colleague Aaron Klug the principal beneficiary, who would receive £3,000 and her Austin car. Her other friends Mair Livingstone would get £2,000, Anne Piper £1,000, and her nurse Miss Griffith £250. The remainder of the estate was to be used for charities.<ref>Maddox, p. 301.</ref>

She returned to work in January 1958, and she was given a promotion to Research Associate in Biophysics on 25 February.<ref>Maddox, p. 302.</ref> She fell ill again on 30 March, and she died on 16 April 1958, in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], London,<ref>GRO Register of Deaths: JUN 1958 5c 257 CHELSEA – Rosalind E.

==Controversies after death==
Various controversies surrounding Rosalind Franklin came to light following her death.

===Alleged sexism towards Franklin===
Anne Sayre, Franklin's friend and one of her biographers, stated in her book ''[[Rosalind Franklin and DNA]],'' "In 1951&nbsp;... King's College London as an institution, was not distinguished for the welcome that it offered to women&nbsp;... Rosalind&nbsp;... was unused to ''[[purdah]]'' [a religious and social institution of female seclusion]&nbsp;... there was one other woman scientist on the laboratory staff".<ref>Sayre, p. 96.</ref> Andrzej Stasiak states "Sayre's book became widely cited in feminist circles for exposing rampant sexism in science."<ref name=stasiak>{{cite journal |last1=Stasiak |first1=Andrzej |title=Rosalind Franklin |journal=EMBO Reports |date=March 2001 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=181 |doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kve037 |pmc=1083834 |url=http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v2/n3/full/embor471.html}}</ref> Farooq Hussain states "there were seven women in the biophysics department&nbsp;...

Sayre states "that while the male staff at King's lunched in a large, comfortable, rather clubby dining room" the female staff of all ranks "lunched in the student's hall or away from the premises".<ref>Sayre, p. 97.</ref><ref>Bryson, B.

Sayre also discusses at length Franklin's struggle in pursuing science, particularly her father's concern about women in academic professions.<ref>Sayre, pp. 42–45.</ref> This account had been taken to accuse Ellis Franklin of sexism against his daughter. A good deal of information explicitly claims that he strongly opposed her entering Newnham College.<ref>McGrayne, p. 6.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rosalind Franklin |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/HF/Biographies%20-%20Women/franklin.htm |publisher=The Manhattan Project Heritage Preservation Association, Inc. |accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lewis |first1=Jone Johnson |title=Rosalind Franklin |url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/sciencechemistry/p/franklin_dna.htm |website=About Education |accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rosalind Franklin |url=http://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/people/Franklin |website=What is Biotechnology |accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref> Franklin's [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) biography goes further by stating that he refused to pay her fees, and that an aunt stepped in for her.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rosalind Franklin |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/bofran.html |website=PBS Online |accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref> Her sister Jenifer Glynn claimed that these stories are myths, and that her parents fully supported Franklin's entire career.<ref name=glynn12>{{cite journal |last1=Glynn |first1=Jenifer |title=Remembering my sister Rosalind Franklin |journal=The Lancet |year=2012 |volume=379 |issue=9821 |pages=1094–1095 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60452-8 |pmid=22451966|s2cid=32832643 }}</ref>

Sexism is said to pervade the memoir of one peer, James Watson, in his book ''The Double Helix'' published 10 years after Franklin's death and after Watson had returned from Cambridge to Harvard.<ref name="Harding2006">{{cite book |last=Harding |first=Sandra |title=Science and Social Inequality: Feminist and Postcolonial Issues |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b6jZAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=10 January 2011 |date=2006 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |isbn=978-0-252-07304-5 |page=71 |chapter=Sexist criticism of Watson's memoir |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=snuYsNzTqOwC&pg=PA71&dq=%22The+Double+Helix%22+sexism#v=onepage&q&f=false |place=Urbana}}</ref> His Cambridge colleague, Peter Pauling, wrote in a letter, "Morris [''sic''] Wilkins is supposed to be doing this work; Miss Franklin is evidently a fool."<ref>{{cite web |title=Quotes by or related to Rosalind Franklin |url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/dna/quotes/rosalind_franklin.html |publisher=Oregon State University Libraries |accessdate=14 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918192430/http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/dna/quotes/rosalind_franklin.html |archive-date=18 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Crick acknowledges later, "I'm afraid we always used to adopt&nbsp;– let's say, a ''patronizing'' attitude towards her."<ref>McGrayne, p. 318.</ref>

Franklin's letter to her parents in January 1939 is often taken as reflecting her own prejudiced attitude and that she was "not immune to the sexism rampant in these circles". In it she remarked one lecturer as "very good, though female".<ref name="Wertheimer2007">{{cite book |last1=Wertheimer |first1=Michael |last2=Clamar |first2=Aphrodite |last3=Siderits |first3=Mary Anne |editor1-last=Gavin |editor1-first=Eileen A. |editor2-last=Clamar |editor2-first=Aphrodite |editor3-last=Siderits |editor3-first=Mary Anne |title=Women of Vision: Their Psychology, Circumstances, and Successes |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |place=New York |isbn=978-0-8261-0253-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVdvhZ0R540C |accessdate=10 January 2011 |chapter=The Case of the Purloined Picture: Rosalind Franklin and the Keystone of the Double Helix }}</ref> But as Maddox explains, it was more of circumstantial comment rather than a gender bias. It was more of an admiration because at the time woman teachers of science were a rarity. She in fact laughed at men who were embarrassed by the appointment of the first female professor [[Dorothy Garrod]].<ref>Maddox, p. 48.</ref>

===Contribution to the model/structure of DNA===
Rosalind Franklin's first important contributions to the model popularised by Crick and Watson was her lecture at the seminar in November 1951, where she presented to those present, among them Watson, the two forms of the molecule, type A and type B, her position being that the phosphate units are located in the external part of the molecule. She also specified the amount of water to be found in the molecule in accordance with other parts of it, data that have considerable importance in terms of the stability of the molecule. Franklin was the first to discover and formulate these facts, which in fact constituted the basis for all later attempts to build a model of the molecule. However, Watson, at the time ignorant of the chemistry, failed to comprehend the crucial information, and this led to construction of a wrong model.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Everson |first1=Ted |title=The Gene: A Historical Perspective |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |isbn=978-0-313-33449-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/genehistoricalpe0000ever/page/85 85] |url=https://archive.org/details/genehistoricalpe0000ever|url-access=registration }}</ref>

The other contribution included an X-ray photograph of B-DNA (called ''[[Photo 51]]'')<ref>Maddox, pp. 177–178.</ref> taken by Franklin's student Gosling that was briefly shown to Watson by Wilkins in January 1953,<ref name="Maddox, p. 196">Maddox, p. 196.</ref><ref>Crick (1988), p. 67.</ref> and a report written for an MRC biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952 which was shown by Perutz at the Cavendish Laboratory to both Crick and Watson. This MRC report contained data from the King's group, including some of Franklin's and Gosling's work, and was given to Crick – who was working on his thesis on [[haemoglobin]] structure – by his thesis supervisor Perutz, a member of the visiting committee.<ref>Elkin, L.O. (2003), p. 44.</ref><ref>Maddox, pp. 198–199.</ref>

Sayre's biography of Franklin contains a story<ref>Sayre, p. 151.</ref> alleging that the photograph 51 in question was shown to Watson by Wilkins without Franklin's permission,<ref name=stasiak/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Minkoff |first1=Eli |last2=Baker |first2=Pamela |title=Biology Today: An Issues Approach |year=2000 |publisher=Garland Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8153-2760-8 |page=58 |edition=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yOKsUSGMWBYC&pg}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Creager |first1=Angela |title=Crystallizing a Life in Science |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/crystallizing-a-life-in-science |website=American Scientist |publisher=Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society |accessdate=25 January 2015 |year=2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112163501/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/crystallizing-a-life-in-science |archivedate=12 November 2014 }}</ref> and that this constituted a case of bad science ethics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stasiak |first1=Andrzej |title=The First Lady of DNA |journal=EMBO Reports |year=2003 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=14 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.embor723 |pmc=1315822}}</ref> Others dispute this story, asserting that Wilkins had been given photograph 51 by Franklin's Ph.D. student Gosling because she was leaving King's to work at Birkbeck, and there was allegedly nothing untoward in this transfer of data to Wilkins<ref name="Maddox, p. 196"/><ref>Wilkins, p. 198.</ref> because Director Randall had insisted that all DNA work belonged exclusively to King's and had instructed Franklin in a letter to even stop working on it and submit her data.<ref>Maddox, p. 312.</ref> Also, it was implied by [[Horace Freeland Judson]], that Maurice Wilkins had taken the photograph out of Franklin's drawer, but this is also said to be incorrect.<ref>Wilkins, p. 257.</ref>

Likewise, Perutz saw "no harm" in showing an MRC report containing the conclusions of Franklin and Gosling's X-ray data analysis to Crick, since it had not been marked as confidential, although "The report was not expected to reach outside eyes".<ref>Maddox, p. 188.</ref> Indeed, after the publication of Watson's ''The Double Helix'' exposed Perutz's act, he received so many letters questioning his judgment that he felt the need to both answer them all<ref>Perutz's papers are in the Archive of the J. Craig Venter institute and Science Foundation in Rockville Maryland, which were purchased as part of the Jeremy Norman Archive of Molecular Biology; quoted in Ferry, Georgina, 2007. Max Perutz and the Secret of Life. Published in the UK by Chatto & Windus ({{ISBN|0-7011-7695-4}}), and in the USA by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</ref> and to post a general statement in ''Science'' excusing himself on the basis of being "inexperienced and casual in administrative matters".<ref>''Science'', 27 June 1969, pp. 207–212, also reprinted in the Norton critical edition of ''The Double Helix'', edited by Gunther Stent.</ref>

Perutz also claimed that the MRC information was already made available to the Cambridge team when Watson had attended Franklin's seminar in November 1951. A preliminary version of much of the important material contained in the 1952 December MRC report had been presented by Franklin in a talk she had given in November 1951, which Watson had attended but not understood.<ref name="Maddox 199"/><ref>Watson (1969).</ref>

The Perutz letter was as said one of three letters, published with letters by Wilkins and Watson, which discussed their various contributions. Watson clarified the importance of the data obtained from the MRC report as he had not recorded these data while attending Franklin's lecture in 1951. The upshot of all this was that when Crick and Watson started to build their model in February 1953 they were working with critical parameters that had been determined by Franklin in 1951, and which she and Gosling had significantly refined in 1952, as well as with published data and other very similar data to those available at King's. It was generally believed that Franklin was never aware that her work had been used during construction of the model,<ref>Maddox, p. 316.</ref> but Gosling asserted in his 2013 interview that, "Yes. Oh, she did know about that."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Attar |first1=N |title=Raymond Gosling: the man who crystallized genes |journal=Genome Biology |year=2013 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=402 |doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-402|pmid=23651528 |pmc=3663117}}</ref>

====Recognition of her contribution to the model of DNA====
Upon the completion of their model, Crick and Watson had invited Wilkins to be a co-author of their paper describing the structure.<ref>Wilkins, p. 213.</ref> Wilkins turned down this offer, as he had taken no part in building the model.<ref>Wilkins, p. 214.</ref> He later expressed regret that greater discussion of co-authorship had not taken place as this might have helped to clarify the contribution the work at King's had made to the discovery.<ref>Wilkins, p. 226.</ref> There is no doubt that Franklin's experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953. Some, including Maddox, have explained this citation omission by suggesting that it may be a question of circumstance, because it would have been very difficult to cite the unpublished work from the MRC report they had seen.<ref name="Maddox 207"/>

Indeed, a clear timely acknowledgment would have been awkward, given the unorthodox manner in which data were transferred from King's to Cambridge. However, methods were available. Watson and Crick could have cited the MRC report as a personal communication or else cited the ''Acta ''articles in press, or most easily, the third ''Nature'' paper that they knew was in press. One of the most important accomplishments of Maddox's widely acclaimed biography is that Maddox made a well-received case for inadequate acknowledgement. "Such acknowledgement as they gave her was very muted and always coupled with the name of Wilkins".<ref>Maddox, pp. 316–317, and other parts of the epilogue.</ref>

Fifteen years after the fact, the first clear recitation of Franklin's contribution appeared as it permeated Watson's account, ''The Double Helix'', although it was buried under descriptions of Watson's (often quite negative) regard towards Franklin during the period of their work on DNA. This attitude is epitomized in the confrontation between Watson and Franklin over a preprint of Pauling's mistaken DNA manuscript.<ref>Watson, J.D. (1968), pp. 95–96.</ref> Watson's words impelled Sayre to write her rebuttal, in which the entire chapter nine, "Winner Take All" has the structure of a legal brief dissecting and analyzing the topic of acknowledgement.<ref>Sayre, A. (1975), pp. 156–167.</ref>

Sayre's early analysis was often ignored because of perceived feminist overtones in her book. Watson and Crick did not cite the X-ray diffraction work of Wilkins and Franklin in their original paper, though they admit having "been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins, Dr. R. E. Franklin and their co-workers at King's College London".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> In fact, Watson and Crick cited no experimental data at all in support of their model. Franklin and Gosling's publication of the DNA X-ray image, in the same issue of ''Nature'', served as the principal evidence:

It took Wilkins and his colleagues about seven years to collect enough data to prove and refine the proposed DNA structure. Moreover, its biological significance, as proposed by Watson and Crick, was not established. General acceptance for the DNA double helix and its function did not start until late in the 1950s, leading to Nobel nominations in 1960, 1961, and 1962 for Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and in 1962 for Nobel Prize in Chemistry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gann |first1=Alexander |last2=Witkowski |first2=Jan A. |title=DNA: Archives reveal Nobel nominations |journal=Nature |year=2013 |volume=496 |issue=7446 |pages=434 |doi=10.1038/496434a |pmid=23619686 |bibcode=2013Natur.496..434G|doi-access=free }}</ref> The first breakthrough was from [[Matthew Meselson]] and [[Franklin Stahl]] in 1958, who experimentally showed the DNA replication of a bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Meselson |first1=Matthew |last2=Stahl |first2=Franklin W. |title=The replication of DNA in Escherichia coli |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1958 |volume=44 |issue=7 |pages=671–682 |doi=10.1073/pnas.44.7.671 |pmid=16590258 |pmc=528642 |bibcode=1958PNAS...44..671M}}</ref> Now known as [[Meselson–Stahl experiment]], DNA was found to replicate into two double-stranded helices, with each helix having one of the original DNA strands.

Franklin's part in the discovery of the nature of DNA was shown in the 1987 TV Movie ''[[Life Story (TV film)|Life Story]]'', starring [[Juliet Stevenson]] as Franklin. With [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Crick, [[Alan Howard]] as Wilkins and [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Watson. This movie portrayed Franklin as somewhat stern, but also alleged that Watson and Crick did use a lot of her work to do theirs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Life Story (TV) |url=http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film622996.html |website=Filmaffinity |accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Life Story |url=http://www.williamnicholson.com/1987/12/life-story/ |publisher=William Nicholson |accessdate=26 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128114439/http://www.williamnicholson.com/1987/12/life-story/ |archivedate=28 January 2015 }}</ref>
