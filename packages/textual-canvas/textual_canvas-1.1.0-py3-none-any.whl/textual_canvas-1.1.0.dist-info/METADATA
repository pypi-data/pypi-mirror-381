## Introduction

`textual-canvas` provides a simple terminal-based drawing canvas widget for
use with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/). Initially developed as a
widget for building
[`textual-mandelbrot`](https://github.com/davep/textual-mandelbrot), it made
sense to spin it out into its own general-purpose library.

## Installing

The package can be installed with `pip` or related tools, for example:

```sh
$ pip install textual-canvas
```

## The library

The library provides one very simple widget for use in Textual: `Canvas`.
This is a scrollable and focusable widget that can be used to colour
"pixels", acting as a basic building block for drawing other things. The
"pixels" themselves are half a character cell in height, hopefully coming
out roughly square in most environments.

See [the documentation](https://textual-canvas.davep.dev/) for an
introduction, a usage guide and detailed API documentation.
