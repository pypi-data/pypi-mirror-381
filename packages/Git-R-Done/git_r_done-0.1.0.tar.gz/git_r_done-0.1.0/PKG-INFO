An interactive script for managing Git operations, GitHub Pages deployment, and SSH key management. This script helps automate common Git tasks and integrates with GitHub Pages and GitHub Codespaces. It also provides utilities for generating and managing SSH keys.

## gitHelper control centre (CLI)

Prefer a guided workflow without leaving the shell? Launch the new **gitHelper control centre** for a colourful, modern command-line experience focused on day-to-day automation tasks:

```bash
python -m git_helper
```

The CLI surfaces the most common actions behind friendly menus and emoji-powered feedback:

* **Repository directory management** – review the active workspace, switch to a different folder, or create it on the fly with automatic validation and recovery when paths are invalid.
* **Repository overview** – quickly list all Git repositories that live under the configured workspace.
* **Git repository workflow** – select or initialise projects, stage files, craft commits, and push/pull with upstream tracking prompts.
* **SSH key concierge** – generate fresh Ed25519 keys, import existing keys into `~/.ssh`, and optionally register them with the local `ssh-agent`, all with detailed success and error messaging.

The interface is implemented as a first-class Python package (`git_helper`) making it easy to install with `pip`, script against, or extend. Rich inline documentation and modular components keep future maintenance approachable.

> Pro tip: type `?` or `help` on any screen to open a contextual help panel summarising available shortcuts and actions.

## Neon Git Cockpit (Terminal UI)

Prefer a neon-lit command center instead of memorising dozens of git commands? Launch the curses-powered **neon git cockpit** and cruise through commits, branches, GitHub issues, and dangerous operations without leaving the terminal.

```text

```

### Cockpit superpowers

* **Repo browser** – scroll commits with ↑/↓, press `Enter` for rich diffs, `Space` to pop into a temporary branch.
* **Branch playground** – jump to the branch graph, fast-forward with `F`, or merge after previewing diff stats.
* **GitHub sync** – hit `G` for live lists of issues, pull requests, and Actions runs (powered by the `gh` CLI). Type `#42` in search to grab a specific PR instantly.
* **Danger zone** – slam `D` to reveal rollback, skull-certified force push, and stashing prompts (with built-in safety nets).
* **Interactive rebase** – `R` launches a GUI-like checklist. Use `p/s/f/e/r/x` to mark actions before executing.
* **Plug-ins** – press `P` for extensibility. A sample “ML-ish commit oracle” plugin analyses your diff and proposes cheeky messages.
* **Themes & vibes** – configuration lives at `~/.config/neon_git/config.json` with presets for GitHub Dark, Matrix Green, and Neon Cyberpunk.

### Quickstart

```bash
python3 neogit.py
```

```bash
python -m git_helper
```

Key hotkeys are always a `?` away:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑/↓` | Navigate commits |
| `Space` | Checkout selected commit in a temporary branch |
| `Tab` | Create a new branch from the highlighted commit |
| `F` | Fast-forward to the tracked main branch |
| `G` | Open GitHub panel (requires [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/)) |
| `R` | Launch interactive rebase planner |
| `P` | Browse and run plug-ins |
| `D` | Toggle the danger zone overlay |
| `/` | Search commits or jump to `#<issue>`/`#<PR>` |
| `U` / `Shift+U` | Undo / redo git state snapshots |
| `Q` | Quit the cockpit |

> **GitHub integration:** the cockpit auto-detects your `origin` remote. Make sure `gh auth login` has been run and the CLI is in PATH.

### Plug-in architecture

Drop Python modules inside `neogit_tui/plugins/` that expose a `register()` function returning a `Plugin`. Each plug-in receives the active `GitInterface` instance, so you can build bots for semantic PR labels, AI commit messages, or workflow dashboards.

```python
from neogit_tui.git import GitInterface
from neogit_tui.plugins import Plugin


def register() -> Plugin:
    def run(git: GitInterface, app) -> str:
        summary = git.diff_stat()
        return f"Diff summary\n{summary}"

    return Plugin(
        name="Diff Summariser",
        description="Show a quick diffstat report",
        run=run,
    )
```

Restart the cockpit and your plug-in appears instantly in the `P` menu.

## Features

### Classic Bash Helper

If you prefer the original guided prompts, the `ghHelper.sh` script is still included.

### General Git Operations:

* **Clone a Repository**: Clone any GitHub repository to your local machine.
* **Create & Checkout Branches**: Create a new branch or switch between existing branches.
* **Add, Commit & Push Changes**: Stage changes with `git add .`, commit changes, and push them to the remote repository.
