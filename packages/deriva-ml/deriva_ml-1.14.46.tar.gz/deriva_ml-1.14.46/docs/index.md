# Welcome to DerivaML

DerivaML is a library designed to improve the reproducibility of machine learning experiments. 
Using DerivaML facilitates the ability to create data that is continously Findable, Accessable, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).  

More details about the principles of continous FAIRness can be found here.
