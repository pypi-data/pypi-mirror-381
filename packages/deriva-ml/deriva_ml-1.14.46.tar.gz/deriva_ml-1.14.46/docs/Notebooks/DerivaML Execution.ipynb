    "## Initializing the environment for an execution\n",
    "\n",
    "In DerivaML, the catalog is the source of record for all of the data created and used by a machine learning experiment.  While we can use the Deriva API to interact directly with the catalog, DerivaML provides a much simpler way of retrieving and adding data to a catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept in this process is an execution.  An execution can be the process of training a model, of executing a model, for running analysis scripts, or even a manual operation.  Every execution in DerivaML is uniquely identified by a *resource identifier* (RID).\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps involved in creating and using an execution are:\n",
    "1. Create an Execution configuration object that identifies the inputs, and code for the execution.\n",
    "2. Create a workflow object to represent the code/operation that you will perform\n",
    "3. Create an execution instance, which will download all of the required inputs from the catalog\n",
    "Locate the input files using methods in the execution instance\n",
    "4. Perform your computation, placing output files in locations provided by the execution instance methods\n",
    "5. Upload the results of the computation using the execution instance methods. This will upload all of your files and tag them with the execution RID so you know how they were generated.  In addition, and new tabular data in CSV format will be uploaded to corrisponding tables in the catalog.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Creating an `ExectutionConfiguration`\n",

A workflow class is intended to be quite general and could be a Python script, a Jupyter notebook, a manual process, or even a Airflow or some other type of workflow system.  In order to create a workflow class instance, we will need to have a name for the workflow, a URI to name the resource that the workflow is capturing, and a workflow type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The url for the workflow will depend on what the workflow is actually doing. In general, its a good idea to make the URL a reference to a tagged code or repository in GitHub. This will require some disiplane on your process to ensure that you always have workflows that are commited and tagged in a repo.\n",
