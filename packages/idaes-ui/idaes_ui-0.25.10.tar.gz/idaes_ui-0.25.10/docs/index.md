# IDAES User Interface Documentation

This documentation describes user interfaces (UIs) for the
Institute for Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES)
Integrated Platform.

This documentation is divided into two main sections:

[User Documentation](#user-documentation)
: For those who wish to use the UIs, including IDAES and other model developers who are using, e.g., the {{ vistitle }} UI for debugging.

[Developer Documentation](#developer-documentation)
: For those who wish to change, add to, or extend the IDAES UIs by changing the UI code itself.
