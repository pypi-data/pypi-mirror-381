"""
Actions module providing high-level functions to interact with Nostr relays.

This module contains functions for fetching events, streaming data, testing
relay capabilities, and computing comprehensive relay metadata. These functions
provide a high-level interface for common Nostr protocol operations.

The main categories of actions include:

Event Operations:
    - fetch_events: Retrieve stored events matching filter criteria
    - stream_events: Continuously stream events as they arrive

Relay Information:
    - fetch_nip11: Retrieve NIP-11 relay information document
    - check_connectivity: Test basic WebSocket connection capability
    - check_readability: Test ability to subscribe and receive events
    - check_writability: Test ability to publish events
    - fetch_nip66: Retrieve comprehensive connection metrics
    - fetch_relay_metadata: Generate comprehensive relay metadata

All functions work with existing Client instances and handle errors gracefully.
Connection testing functions automatically detect proof-of-work requirements
from relay NIP-11 metadata when available.

Example:
    Basic usage of action functions:

    >>> # Create relay and client
    >>> relay = Relay("wss://relay.damus.io")
    >>> client = Client(relay)

    >>> # Test relay capabilities
    >>> metadata = await fetch_relay_metadata(client, private_key, public_key)
    >>> print(f"Relay is {'readable' if metadata.readable else 'not readable'}")

    >>> # Fetch events
    >>> async with client:
    ...     filter = Filter(kinds=[1], limit=10)
    ...     events = await fetch_events(client, filter)
    ...     print(f"Retrieved {len(events)} events")

    >>> # Stream events continuously
    >>> async with client:
    ...     filter = Filter(kinds=[1])
    ...     async for event in stream_events(client, filter):
    ...         print(f"New event: {event.content}")

    Compute comprehensive relay metadata including NIP-11 and connection data.

    This function performs a complete relay analysis by fetching NIP-11
