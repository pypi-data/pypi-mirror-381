  title: "Milestone v2.14.0 - Elimination of Over-Engineering: Return to Core Data Collection Competency"
  description: |
    Revolutionary architectural simplification removing the GaplessDataFrame calculation layer
    to refocus on core data collection competency. This milestone represents a major lesson in
    user-driven development and the dangers of premature optimization. Based on direct user
    feedback questioning the need for calculation accelerations, this breaking change eliminates
    771 lines of complex calculation engine code and returns to simple pandas DataFrame operations.
    Demonstrates the power of focusing on core value propositions and avoiding feature creep.
