  title: "Milestone v2.12.0 - GaplessDataFrame Enhanced Domain-Specific Time Series API"
  description: |
    Revolutionary enhancement introducing GaplessDataFrame as pandas DataFrame subclass with
    domain-specific cryptocurrency analysis methods. This milestone represents completion of
    enhanced DataFrame functionality that eliminates manual df.set_index('date') boilerplate
    while maintaining 100% backward compatibility. Transforms cryptocurrency data analysis
    workflow from manual setup to immediate domain-specific operations.

        solution: "Moved to module-level scope with proper isolation to ensure test independence"

      - description: "Floating-point precision in variance calculations needed calibration"
        impact: "Mathematical operations on financial data require careful precision handling"
        discovery_process: "Default 10-decimal precision too strict for variance calculations with market data"
        solution: "Adjusted to 8-decimal precision for reliable variance validation in financial context"

        impact: "Pandas DataFrame subclassing has subtle requirements for proper inheritance"
        discovery_process: "Initial attempts failed to properly preserve DataFrame behavior in operations"
