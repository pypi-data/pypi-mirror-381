  description: |
    Revolutionary advancement introducing API-only probe hooks for AI agent discovery alongside
    custom uv-native PEP 517 build backend implementation. This milestone represents a major
    leap in AI coding agent integration patterns and build system modernization. The implementation
    balances complex technical requirements with user accessibility through deterministic JSON
    outputs and phased stateless AI agent discovery architecture (Phase 0→1→2).

    Key achievement: 623 lines of sophisticated infrastructure (271 lines custom build backend +
    352 lines probe hooks) enabling seamless AI agent package exploration while maintaining
    production-grade PyPI publishing compatibility and SBOM generation integration.
