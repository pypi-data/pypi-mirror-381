  # Hard-Learned Lessons from Dependency Pruning
  lessons_learned:
    challenges:
      - description: "Identifying truly over-engineered vs genuinely necessary complexity"
        impact: "Required systematic analysis of actual vs theoretical benefits of each dependency"
        discovery_process: "Empirical testing revealed PyOD regression detection was solving non-existent problems"

      - description: "Maintaining backward compatibility while removing core functionality"
        impact: "Risk of breaking existing user workflows and scripts"
        discovery_process: "CSV format retention as default ensures zero breaking changes for existing users"

      - description: "Mixed pandas/polars ecosystem creating cognitive overhead"
        impact: "Developers needed to understand two DataFrame paradigms for single codebase"
        discovery_process: "Code reviews consistently showed confusion between pandas and polars syntax patterns"

    failed_approaches:
      - approach: "Incremental dependency reduction across multiple minor versions"
        reason_failed: "Created inconsistent intermediate states with partial functionality"
        lesson: "Architectural simplification requires atomic commits for clean state transitions"

      - approach: "Maintaining polars for streaming while using pandas for core operations"
        reason_failed: "Created unnecessary data conversion overhead and dual maintenance burden"
        lesson: "Single DataFrame paradigm eliminates conversion costs and cognitive complexity"

      - approach: "Keeping PyOD for optional advanced regression detection"
        reason_failed: "Advanced statistical methods were unused in practice; 3-sigma detection sufficient"
        lesson: "Implement simplest solution first; add complexity only when empirically proven necessary"

    successful_solution:
      approach: "Atomic architectural simplification with high-value feature addition (Parquet)"
      key_insights:
        - "Dependency reduction paired with format enhancement provides clear user value proposition"
        - "Pandas-exclusive standardization eliminates ecosystem confusion and reduces learning curve"
        - "pyarrow constraint relaxation (>=16.0.0) enables compatibility with external tools like getml"
        - "Snappy compression provides optimal speed/size balance for financial time series data"
