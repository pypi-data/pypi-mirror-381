summary: Timeframe discoverability implementation with --list-timeframes flag and comprehensive CLI patterns

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Discoverability gap where only 8 of 16 available timeframes were documented in CLI help text
      impact: Users could not easily discover all available timeframe options through conventional CLI patterns

    - description: Error messages for invalid timeframes provided limited guidance without showing available alternatives
      impact: Users had to reference documentation or source code to understand valid timeframe options

    - description: CLI help text lacked reference to timeframe listing functionality for complete option discovery
      impact: Users were unaware that comprehensive timeframe information was available through dedicated commands

    - description: Test coverage needed expansion to validate timeframe discoverability across multiple CLI interaction patterns
      impact: Comprehensive testing required to ensure discoverability functionality works correctly in all usage scenarios

    - description: Conventional CLI patterns required implementation for timeframe option discovery using --list-* flag pattern
      impact: Following established CLI conventions improves user experience and discoverability expectations

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Including all 16 timeframes directly in help text without separate listing command
      reason_failed: Would have cluttered help output and violated CLI best practices for handling large option sets
      lesson: Use dedicated --list-* commands for comprehensive option display while keeping help text concise

    - approach: Minimal error messages without available timeframe suggestions when invalid options provided
      reason_failed: Users would still need to find available options elsewhere instead of immediate guidance
      lesson: Error messages should provide actionable guidance including available alternatives and discovery commands

    - approach: Basic test coverage assuming existing CLI tests covered timeframe discoverability scenarios
      reason_failed: Timeframe discoverability required specific test scenarios beyond general CLI functionality
      lesson: New discoverability features require dedicated test coverage for flag functionality, help text, and error handling

    - approach: Inconsistent help text between main command and subcommands regarding timeframe options
      reason_failed: Users could encounter different information depending on command context creating confusion
      lesson: Maintain consistent discoverability information across all CLI command contexts

  successful_solution:
    approach: Conventional CLI discoverability implementation with --list-timeframes flag and comprehensive user guidance
    key_insights:
      - --list-timeframes flag provides complete timeframe listing with descriptions following CLI conventions

  architecture_changes: |
    Timeframe Discoverability Architecture (v2.1.1):

    BEFORE (v2.1.0):
    - Help text showed only 8 of 16 available timeframes
    - No dedicated timeframe listing functionality
    - Basic error messages without alternative suggestions
    - Limited discoverability for complete timeframe options

    AFTER (v2.1.1):
    - --list-timeframes flag with all 16 timeframes and descriptions
    - Help text references "16 available options" and --list-timeframes
    - Error messages show available timeframes with discovery guidance
    - Comprehensive test coverage for discoverability functionality

    CLI Flag Implementation:
    ```python
    def list_timeframes() -> int:
        """Display all available timeframes with descriptions."""
        print("üìä Available Timeframes")

        # Get available timeframes from collector
        collector = BinancePublicDataCollector()
        timeframes = collector.available_timeframes

        # Display with descriptions and usage examples
        for tf in timeframes:
            desc = descriptions.get(tf, "Standard trading interval")
            print(f"{tf:9} | {desc}")
    ```

    Help Text Enhancement:
    ```python
    # BEFORE: Limited timeframe information
    help="Comma-separated timeframes (default: 1m,3m,5m,15m,30m,1h,2h,4h)"

    # AFTER: Complete discoverability reference
    help="Comma-separated timeframes from 16 available options (default: 1m,3m,5m,15m,30m,1h,2h,4h). Use --list-timeframes to see all available timeframes"
    ```

    Error Message Expansion:
    ```python
    # BEFORE: Basic error message
    print(f"‚ùå Timeframe {trading_timeframe} not available")

    # AFTER: Comprehensive guidance
    print(f"‚ùå Timeframe '{trading_timeframe}' not available")
    print(f"üìä Available timeframes: {', '.join(self.available_timeframes)}")
    print(f"üí° Use 'gapless-crypto-data --list-timeframes' for detailed descriptions")
    ```

    Test Coverage Implementation:
    ```python
    # New timeframe discoverability tests
    def test_cli_list_timeframes_flag():
        # Validates --list-timeframes functionality with all 16 timeframes

    def test_cli_help_mentions_list_timeframes():
        # Validates help text includes discoverability references

    def test_cli_invalid_timeframe_shows_available():
        # Validates error messages provide available alternatives

    def test_cli_timeframe_discoverability_integration():
        # Validates complete discoverability workflow
    ```

    Argument Parsing Enhancement:
    ```python
    # Add --list-timeframes flag to argument parser
    parser.add_argument("--list-timeframes", action="store_true",
                       help="List all available timeframes with descriptions")

    # Route to timeframe listing function
    if parsed_arguments.list_timeframes:
        return list_timeframes()
    ```

migration_notes: |
  v2.1.0 to v2.1.1 Migration (Timeframe Discoverability):
  - Fully backwards compatible: all existing CLI usage continues unchanged
  - New functionality: --list-timeframes flag for comprehensive timeframe discovery
  - Enhanced help text references complete timeframe information
  - Improved error messages with available alternatives and discovery guidance

  Timeframe Discovery Patterns:
  ```bash
  # List all available timeframes with descriptions
  gapless-crypto-data --list-timeframes

  # Help text now mentions 16 available options
  gapless-crypto-data --help
  gapless-crypto-data collect --help

  # Error messages provide discovery guidance
  gapless-crypto-data --symbol BTCUSDT --timeframes invalid_timeframe
  # Shows: Available timeframes and suggests --list-timeframes
  ```

  Discoverability Workflow:
  ```bash
  # Step 1: Discover available timeframes
  gapless-crypto-data --list-timeframes
  # Output: All 16 timeframes with descriptions and usage examples

  # Step 2: Use discovered timeframes
  gapless-crypto-data --symbol BTCUSDT --timeframes 1s,1m,1h,1d

  # Step 3: Get help with timeframe references
  gapless-crypto-data --help
  # Output: "from 16 available options... Use --list-timeframes"
  ```

  Test Validation:
  ```bash
  # Validate timeframe discoverability functionality
  uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py::test_cli_list_timeframes_flag -v
  uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py::test_cli_help_mentions_list_timeframes -v
  uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py::test_cli_invalid_timeframe_shows_available -v

  # Complete discoverability integration test
  uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py::test_cli_timeframe_discoverability_integration -v

  # All CLI tests including new discoverability coverage
  uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py -v  # 18 tests total
  ```

retrospective_summary: |
  v2.1.1 represents a successful implementation of timeframe discoverability functionality that addresses
  the user experience gap where only 8 of 16 available timeframes were easily discoverable through CLI
  help text, establishing conventional CLI patterns for complete option discovery.

  The most significant improvement is the addition of the --list-timeframes flag following established
  CLI conventions for comprehensive option listing. This provides users with detailed information about
  all 16 available timeframes including descriptions, usage examples, and performance notes, enabling
  informed decision making for timeframe selection.

  Help text enhancement to reference "16 available options" and --list-timeframes creates clear pathways
  for users to discover complete timeframe information while maintaining concise primary documentation.
  This balance between brief help text and comprehensive option discovery follows CLI best practices.

  Error message expansion provides immediate actionable guidance when invalid timeframes are specified,
  showing available alternatives and suggesting the discovery command. This eliminates the need for users
  to search documentation or source code for valid options, improving error recovery experience.

  The comprehensive test coverage with 4 new tests validates timeframe discoverability across multiple
  interaction patterns including flag functionality, help text integration, error handling, and complete
  workflow scenarios. This systematic testing ensures the discoverability features work correctly.

  Key insight: CLI discoverability benefits significantly from following established conventions rather
  than creating custom patterns. The --list-* flag pattern immediately communicates functionality to
  users familiar with CLI tools, reducing learning overhead and improving adoption.

  The implementation demonstrates that user experience improvements can be achieved without architectural
  complexity or performance impact. The discoverability functionality adds minimal overhead while
  providing substantial usability benefits through conventional interface patterns.

  Error handling with immediate alternative suggestions and discovery guidance represents best practices
  for CLI error recovery. Users receive actionable information at the point of failure rather than
  generic error messages requiring additional research.

  The consistent messaging across main command and subcommands maintains user experience coherence
  regardless of command context. Users encounter the same discoverability information whether using
  direct flags or subcommand patterns.

  This milestone establishes patterns for extending CLI discoverability that prioritize conventional
  user interface patterns, comprehensive testing, and error recovery guidance. The systematic approach
  to option discovery provides a template for future CLI enhancements.

  The successful implementation of timeframe discoverability demonstrates that thoughtful attention to
  CLI conventions and user experience patterns can significantly improve tool usability while maintaining
  system simplicity and performance. The 4 new tests and conventional --list-* pattern ensure robust
  and accessible timeframe discovery functionality.
