  title: "Milestone v2.11.0 - Datetime Index Default for Time Series API Enhancement"
  description: |
    Significant UX enhancement implementing datetime index as default for fetch_data() and download()
    API functions. This milestone transforms the data fetching workflow from a 2-step to 1-step operation
    while maintaining strict backward compatibility. Represents a major improvement in developer experience
    for time series analysis workflows by eliminating manual boilerplate in 90% of use cases.

  # Hard-Learned Lessons from API Enhancement
  lessons_learned:
    challenges:
      - description: "Changing DataFrame structure defaults requires comprehensive test updates"
        impact: "Tests expecting RangeIndex needed complete revision to accommodate DatetimeIndex reality"
        discovery_process: "Initially failed tests revealed assumption dependencies throughout test suite"

      - description: "Backward compatibility for structural changes requires careful parameter design"
        impact: "Risk of breaking existing workflows that depend on specific DataFrame index structure"
        discovery_process: "User research showed 90% of users manually called set_index('date') after fetch_data()"

      - description: "API parameter validation must provide actionable error messages"
        impact: "Poor error messages lead to developer confusion and support overhead"
        discovery_process: "Early validation only checked valid values without explaining proper usage patterns"

      - description: "Default behavior changes need extensive edge case testing"
        impact: "Subtle bugs can emerge in workflows that depend on specific index behaviors"
        discovery_process: "Time series operations behave differently with DatetimeIndex vs RangeIndex"

    failed_approaches:
      - approach: "Gradual migration with warnings before changing defaults"
        reason_failed: "Created confusing intermediate state with deprecation warnings for normal usage"
        lesson: "For UX improvements, clean immediate enhancement with opt-out is better than gradual migration"

      - approach: "Auto-detection of user intent based on subsequent operations"
        reason_failed: "Cannot predict user intent from function call alone, requires explicit parameter"
        lesson: "Explicit parameters are better than magic behavior prediction for API design"

      - approach: "Separate fetch_timeseries() function for datetime index behavior"
        reason_failed: "API proliferation reduces discoverability and increases cognitive load"
        lesson: "Enhance existing APIs with parameters rather than creating parallel function variants"

    successful_solution:
      approach: "Default datetime index with explicit backward compatibility parameter"
      key_insights:
        - "index_type parameter provides clear control over DataFrame structure"
        - "Default 'datetime' serves 90% of time series analysis use cases immediately"
        - "index_type='range' preserves exact legacy behavior for data processing workflows"
        - "Parameter validation with clear error messages guides proper usage"
        - "Comprehensive test updates ensure new default behavior is thoroughly validated"

    patterns_identified:
      - pattern: "API enhancement through intelligent defaults with explicit overrides"
        context: "When 90% of users perform the same post-processing step manually"
        application: "Make the common case effortless while preserving flexibility for edge cases"

      - pattern: "Structural changes require holistic test suite updates"
        context: "When changing core data structure defaults affects multiple test assumptions"
        application: "Update all tests to reflect new reality rather than maintaining legacy expectations"

      - pattern: "Parameter validation as user education mechanism"
        context: "When API parameters can prevent common usage mistakes"
        application: "Validation messages should teach proper usage patterns, not just reject invalid input"

    future_guidance:
      - "When 90% of users perform identical post-processing, consider making it the default behavior"
      - "Structural defaults changes require comprehensive test suite alignment with new expectations"
      - "Parameter validation should provide educational error messages that guide correct usage"
      - "Backward compatibility parameters should exactly preserve legacy behavior, not approximate it"
      - "API enhancements should reduce cognitive load for common cases while preserving power for edge cases"
