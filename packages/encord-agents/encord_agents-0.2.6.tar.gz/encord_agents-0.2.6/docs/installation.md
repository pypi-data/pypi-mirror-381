If you just want to install `encord-agents` in your current environment, you can run:

```shell
python -m pip install encord-agents
```

You can optionally include additional dependencies used for working with visual files such as Images, Videos, Image Groups / Sequences by running:

```shell
python -m pip install encord-agents[vision]
```

!!! info
    We recommend installing this for most use cases, as our methods are optimized for fast, easy handling of visual files. It is optional to support serverless setups where you wish to avoid bundle size, or Agents that do not need visual data â€” such as those working only with labels, priorities, text, PDFs, or audio. 

!!! warning
    This Project requires `python >= 3.10`. If you do not have Python 3.10, we recommend using, e.g., [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv){ target="\_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" } to manage your Python versions.

## Using an Isolated Environment (Recommended)

We recommend installing the Encord agents library in an isolated environment. There are several options available. 

### Venv

1. Create a new virtual environment. In this example, we name it `agents-venv` but you can choose any name you see fit.

```shell
python -m venv agents-venv
```

2. Next, activate your virtual environment. This ensures that any modules you install remain isolated and that all previously installed modules in the environment are available for use in Python.

```shell
source agents-venv/bin/activate
```

3. Once activated, the environment name is displayed before the cursor in your terminal.

```shell title="example"
(agents-venv) $
```

4. Install the `encord-agents` library.

```shell
python -m pip install encord-agents
```

### Poetry

If you already have a Poetry project, you can add `encord-agents` to that project:

```shell
poetry add encord-agents
```

### Conda

1. Create a conda environment.

```
conda create -n agents python>=3.10
```

2. We suggest activating your conda environment.

```shell
conda activate agents
```

3. Once activated, the environment name is displayed before the cursor in your terminal.

```shell title="example"
(agents) $
```

4. Install the `encord-agents` library.

```shell
python -m pip install encord-agents
```

## Dependencies

The dependencies for `encord-agents` are kept lightweight, with the largest dependencies being `numpy` with `opencv-python-headless` also included in `encord-agents[vision]`.
