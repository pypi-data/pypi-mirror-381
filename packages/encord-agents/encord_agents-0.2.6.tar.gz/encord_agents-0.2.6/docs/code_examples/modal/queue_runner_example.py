# Modal Queue Runner Example

This example demonstrates how to use Modal.com to process Encord Agents tasks in a distributed way.

## Prerequisites

- A Modal account and CLI setup (https://modal.com/docs/guide)
- Encord Agents package installed
- An Encord project to process
- Modal SSH key secret configured (named "encord-ssh-key")

## Overview

This example shows how to:

1. Configure a Modal app with required dependencies
2. Set up a QueueRunner to manage Encord tasks
3. Define an agent stage as a Modal function
4. Process tasks in parallel using Modal's distributed computing

## How it Works

The example:

1. Creates a Modal app with a Debian-based environment
2. Sets up a QueueRunner connected to an Encord project
3. Defines a simple agent that extracts the last 8 characters of label titles
4. Processes tasks in parallel using Modal's map functionality

## Setting up authentication

You need to [authenticate](../authentication.md) with Encord first.
Once you have a private ssh key (preferably corresponding to a service account), you should also ensure that you have [signed up for Modal](https://modal.com/signup).

Now you can configure the secret:

1. Go to [https://modal.com/secrets](https://modal.com/secrets)
2. Click "Create new secret"
3. Choose the "Custom" option
4. Name it `encord-ssh-key` (ensure that any name you choose matches the name in the code below)
5. Add an environment variable names `ENCORD_SSH_KEY` with the content of your private ssh key file. Similar to the figure below.

This setup allows `encord-agents` to authenticate with Encord using the provided key.

## Usage

```bash
modal run queue_runner_example.py
```

You can follow the progress of the tasks on the Modal dashboard: [https://modal.com/apps](https://modal.com/apps)

## Code Structure

- `APP_NAME`: Defines the Modal app name
- `stage_1`: Main agent function decorated with Modal and QueueRunner
- `last_eight`: Helper function to process label rows
- `main`: Entry point that executes the parallel processing

## Configuration

Update the following values for your use case:

- `project_hash`: Your Encord project hash
- `concurrency_limit`: Number of parallel executions (default: 5)
