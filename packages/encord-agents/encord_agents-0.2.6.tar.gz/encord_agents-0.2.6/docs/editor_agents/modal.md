[Modal][modal-docs] provides a serverless cloud for engineers and researchers who want to build compute-intensive applications without thinking about infrastructure.
The cloud service is well suited for building and hosting Encord Editor Agents.

This example places a bitmask "ball" in the center of an image in the Label Editor.

!!! tip
    See the Editor Agent [examples](./examples/index.md) for more sophisticated use cases.

!!! info
    Everything in the *FastAPI examples* can also be done using Modal, as Modal acts as a wrapper around FastAPI.

This page is not intended to explain everything that [Modal][modal-docs] can do -- as it does a lot --, but it does provide a working example.

!!! tip
    For a complete code example, go [here]({{ config.repo_url }}/blob/main/docs/code_examples/modal/editor_add_bitmask.py).

## STEP 1: Authentication

You need to [authenticate](../authentication.md) with Encord first.
Once you have a private ssh key (preferably corresponding to a service account), you should also ensure that you have [signed up for Modal](https://modal.com/signup).

Now you can configure the secret:

1. Go to [https://modal.com/secrets](https://modal.com/secrets)
2. Click "Create new secret"
3. Choose the "Custom" option
4. Name it `encord-ssh-key` (you can choose the name but it needs to match the name in the code below)
5. Add an environment variable names `ENCORD_SSH_KEY` with the content of your private ssh key file. Similar to the figure below.

![Modal environment variable configuration](../assets/modal_setup_env_variable.png)

This setup allows `encord-agents` to authenticate with Encord using the provided key.

## STEP 2: Installation

Ensure that you have installed `encord-agents` and `modal`:

```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install encord-agents modal
```

## STEP 3: Inspecting the Modal Template

Now you need a template for creating an endpoint that can be used for defining an Editor Agent.

The following example:  

1. **Creates a Docker Image** â€“ We define a container that includes all necessary dependencies:  
   - `encord-agents[vision]`: The library for building agents
   - `modal`: For hosting the agent
   - `libgl`: Required by `opencv`

   Modal automatically handles setting up this container for you.  

2. **Defines an App** â€“ We create a FastAPI application to manage the agent's endpoints.  

3. **Sets Up Authentication** â€“ We add an endpoint that uses an SSH key for authentication.  
   - The SSH key should be stored as `ENCORD_SSH_KEY`.  
   - `encord-agents` automatically detects this key and use it to authenticate with the Encord SDK.  

4. **Implements the Agent Logic** â€“ defines what the agent should do when triggered.  
   - Check out [these examples](./examples/index.md#fastapi-examples) to see different ways to customize your agent.  

Since this is a FastAPI route, you can also take advantage of built-in dependencies from [`encord_agents.fastapi.dependencies`](../reference/editor_agents.md#encord_agents.fastapi.dependencies) to simplify your setup.

```python
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from fastapi import Depends
from encord_agents.fastapi.dependencies import LabelRowV2, dep_label_row
from encord_agents import FrameData

import modal

# 1. Define the docker image that will run the code.
image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.12").pip_install(
        "fastapi[standard]",
        "encord-agents[vision]",
    )
)

# 2. Define the app that will hold the endpoint
app = modal.App(name="encord-agents-add-ball", image=image)


# 3. Define the endpoint with access to the secret that we set up.
@app.function(secrets=[modal.Secret.from_name("encord-ssh-key")])
@modal.web_endpoint(method="POST")
def put_ball_on_image(
    frame_data: FrameData,
    label_row: Annotated[LabelRowV2, Depends(dep_label_row)],
):
	# 4. The agent logic goes here
	# This is really a FastAPI endpoint âœ¨
	...
```

Next, you must define some logic to go into the agent.

## STEP 4: Defining the Agent

The following example adds a circular bitmask in the middle of the current frame.
However, it could easily be running your own model ([even on the GPU](https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu)).

In the function definition of your route, add the following code to: 

1. Ensure that the Project's Ontology has a bitmask object. If it does not, there's nothing to do here.
2. Ensure that the task is a visual data unit (an image, image group, image sequence, or video).
3. Places a bitmask with the appropriate shape and fills in a sphere.
4. Adds the bitmask to the label row.
5. Saves the labels.

```python
@app.function(secrets=[modal.Secret.from_name("encord-ssh-key")])
@modal.web_endpoint(method="POST")
def put_ball_on_image(
    frame_data: FrameData,
    label_row: Annotated[LabelRowV2, Depends(dep_label_row)],
):
    # 1. Find the first bitmask ontology object
	#    Exit if no one is found
    bitmask_object = next(
        (o for o in label_row.ontology_structure.objects if o.shape == Shape.BITMASK),
        None,
    )
    bitmask_object = next((o for o in label_row.ontology_structure.objects if o.shape == Shape.BITMASK), None)
    if not bitmask_object:
        return

    # 2. Ensure we can read image width/height
	#	 Otherwise, it's probably not a vision asset
    w, h = label_row.width, label_row.height
    if w is None or h is None:
        return

    # 3. Construct bitmask with ball in the center
    cw, ch = w//2, h//2
    radius = min(cw, ch) // 2
    mask = np.zeros((h, w), dtype=np.uint8)
    cv2.circle(mask, (cw, ch), radius, 255, -1)  # type: ignore


    # 4. Add it as a label
    ins = bitmask_object.create_instance()
    ins.set_for_frames(
        frames=frame_data.frame,
        confidence=0.8,
        coordinates=BitmaskCoordinates(mask > 0)
    )
    label_row.add_object_instance(ins)

    # 5. Save update
    label_row.save()
```

Upon completion, the `encord_agents` library sends a 200 response to the Label Editor, causing the editor to refresh its state. The result is a sphere in the middle of the image.

## STEP 5: Testing the Agent

To test the agent, there is a dedicated CLI tool.
You must first run the agent locally (with your Python environment sourced).
Assuming that the python file you created is named `example.py`, you can run:

```shell
modal serve example.py
```

The command should print a url similar to this

```
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ”¨ Created web function put_ball_on_image =>
    https://<your_project>-put-ball-on-image-dev.modal.run
```

Let's call it `<agent_url>`.

Now, go to the Encord Label Editor in your browser, viewing an asset for which you would like to test your agent.
Copy the url; let's call it `<editor_url>`.
It should follow this pattern:

```
https://app.encord.com/label_editor/<project_hash>/<data_hash>/<frame>
```

With the endpoint running, you can from another terminal window run:

```
encord_agents test custom '<agent_url>' '<editor_url>'
```

Where you replace the `<agent_url>` and the `<editor_url>` with the relevant urls.
You should see a green box detaining the request and the response.

If the status code is 200, refresh your browser to see the new bitmask in the Label Editor.

## STEP 6: Deployment

When you are done developing your agent, run the following to deploy your agent.

```shell
modal deploy example.py
```

Copy the displayed url and configure it in the Encord platform by following [the documentation](https://docs.encord.com/platform-documentation/Annotate/automated-labeling/annotate-editor-agents).

Once that is done, you can right-click the frame in the Label Editor to trigger the agent. If you are interested in a more involved Modal example, please see [Cotracker3 Modal](./examples/index.md#cotracker3-keypoint-tracking)
