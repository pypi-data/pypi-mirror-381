weigh packages and parcels. Each brand has a different communication
protocol. This module provides an framework to interface such devices
with Odoo.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Installation
============

This module by itself does not do anything.

You will need to install a module implementing the communication with
your device. Look for modules with a name starting with
stock_measuring_device.

Configuration
=============

The first step is to configure the Packaging Types (Pallet, Box, ...) in
Inventory > Configuration > Product Packaging Types.

Configure the measuring device in Inventory > Configuration > Measuring
Devices, don't forget to set the device type, and any other additional
parameters.

Usage
=====

Use the "Wizard" button on a Measuring Device to open the screen and
take measurements.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- The UI could get some improvements
- Being able to open the measurement screen from a product would be nice
