! Connection file to the MARCONI supercomputer at CINECA
! this is just an example.
! MARCONI works with standard slurm utilities
! therefore no custom variable declaration is needed

&cluster
	! Connection info
	hostname = "marconi"
	account = "IscrB_COMRED"
	partition_name = "knl_usr_prod"

	! This is necessary, the directory in which to carry the
	! simulation.
	! You can use the evironmental variables of the cluster,
	! they will be parsed correctly.
	! This directory will be created if not present
	workdir = "$WORK/test"

	! The path to the executable (qe in this case)
	! NPOOL will be replaced by n_pools, while PREFIX with the name
	binary_path = "$HOME/qe-6.2.1/bin/pw.x -npool NPOOL -i PREFIX.pwi > PREFIX.pwo"

	! The command for the parallel mpi execution
	! NPROC will be substituted with the right choice.
	mpicmd = "srun --mpi=pmi2 --exclusive -n NPROC "


	!NOTE:
	!You can specify a password in this way:
	!pwd = "ciaociao"
	!But it is not save to store the password in clear text.
	!I recommend you  to use a public-private key crittografy instead.
	!(To use pwd keyword you need to have sshpass installed)

	! Resources (I think they are pretty self explaining)
	n_nodes = 1
	n_cpu = 16 
	n_pools = 1
	n_time = "00:01:00"  ! 10 seconds (it must be a string)
	! Note you can also specify the ram as n_ram

	! We can specify the submission strategy
	! This means 10 jobs per works
	job_numbers = 10
	! Runned togheter 2 by 2 (sharing the same nodes)
	n_together = 1
	timeout=6 ! Max number of second per single job

!
! This is the setup of a QE calculator
! It is used in the cluster
!
&calculator
	! The calculator type
	program = "quantum-espresso"
	
	! We take only a gamma point calculation
	k_points = 2 2 1
	k_offset = 0 0 1

	! Here the pseudopotentials
	! Note they are pseudo_ followed by the atom name
	pseudo_H = "H.bare.upf"

	! Here all the specific qe variables
	tprnfor = .true.
	tstress = .true.
	ecutwfc = 60
	ecutrho = 240
	occupations = "smearing"
	smearing = "mv"
	degauss = 0.03
	input_dft = "blyp"
	disk_io = "none" ! This is very important!!!
