    "# Second order phase transitions and structural instabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main big features of the self-consistent harmonic approximation (SCHA) is that it provides a complete theoretical framework to study second order phase-transitions for structural instabilities.\n",
    "Examples are charge density wave, ferroelectric materials or structural deformation.\n",
    "An example application for each one of this case is reported, carried out with the SSCHA package:\n",
    "1. [Bianco et. al. Nano Lett. 2019, 19, 5, 3098-3103](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b00504)\n",

    "3. [Bianco et. al. Phys. Rev. B 97, 214101](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.214101)\n",

    "According to the Landau theory of second order phase transitions, a phase transition occurs when the free energy curvature around the high-symmetry structure on the direction of the order parameter becomes negative:\n",
    "![](second_order.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For structural phase transitions, the order parameter is associated to phonon atomic displacements. So we just need to calculate the Free energy Hessian, as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial R_a \\partial R_b} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "here, $a$ and $b$ encodes both atomic and cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "This quantity is very hard to compute with a finite difference approach, as it would require a SSCHA calculation for all possible atomic displacements (keeping atoms fixed), and the Free energy is affected by stochastic noise. Luckily, SSCHA provides an analitical equation for the free energy hessian, derived by Raffaello Bianco in the work [Bianco et. al. Phys. Rev. B 96, 014111](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.014111).\n",
    "The free energy curvature can be writte in matrical form as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial {R_a}\\partial {R_b}} = \\Phi_{ab} + \\sum_{cdef} \\stackrel{(3)}{\\Phi}_{acd}[1 - \\Lambda\\stackrel{(4)}{\\Phi}]^{-1}_{cdef} \\stackrel{(3)}{\\Phi}_{efb}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\Phi$ is the SCHA force constant matrix obtained by the auxiliary harmonic hamiltonian, $\\stackrel{(3,4)}{\\Phi}$ are the average of the 3rd and 4th derivative of the Born-Oppenheimer energy landscape on the SCHA density matrix, while the $\\Lambda$ tensor is a function of the frequencies of the auxiliary harmonic hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, this complex equation can be evaluated from the ensemble with a simple function call:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ensemble.get_free_energy_hessian()\n",
    "```\n",
