Graphical User Interface
========================

The Waveform Editor provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI), with which you can:

* Create, load, edit, and save waveform configurations from YAML files.
* View plots of one or multiple waveforms simultaneously for comparison.
* Edit waveforms through a text editor with live plot updates and error
  highlighting.
* Export waveform data to various formats, including IDS, CSV, PNG, and PCSSP XML.
* Graphically edit and design the desired plasma shape using NICE.

Launching the GUI
-----------------

The GUI can be launched using the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    waveform-editor gui


You can also optionally specify a YAML file to load on startup:

.. code-block:: bash

    waveform-editor gui /path/to/your/waveforms.yaml

.. note::

  This normally opens automatically in your default web browser. If it does not, 
  you can manually open the app in a web browser by going to the address printed in the terminal.
  For example, when the ``waveform-editor gui`` command has the following output, the app is running
  on the web address ``http://localhost:38895``.

  .. code-block:: console

      $ waveform-editor gui
      [...]
      Launching server at http://localhost:38895

File Handling
-------------

All file operations are managed through the **File** menu located at the top of the
sidebar. This menu allows you to create, open, save, and export waveform
configurations. The name of the currently open file is displayed next to the menu.
An asterisk (``*``) next to the filename indicates that there are unsaved changes.

   File Menu Interface



Opening a Configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can start a new configuration or open an existing one from the sidebar's
**File** menu.

* To start a new, empty waveform configuration, click **File > ✏️ New**. 

* To load an existing waveform configuration from a YAML file, click
  **File > 📁 Open...**. This will open a file dialog where you can navigate to and
  select your ``.yaml`` file.

Saving a Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can save your work in two ways:

* **File > 💾 Save**: This option saves the current configuration to the currently
  open file. If you are working on a new, untitled configuration, it will trigger
  the "Save As" dialog instead.
* **File > 💾 Save As...**: This opens a file dialog, allowing you to save the
  current configuration to a new file or overwrite an existing one.

Exporting a Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To export the waveform data, click **File > 📤 Export...**. This opens the export
dialog, which provides several options:

1.  **Output type**: Choose the desired format for the export.

    * **IDS**: Exports the data to an IMAS database entry. You must provide a valid
      IMAS URI.
    * **CSV**: Exports all waveforms into a single CSV file, with a time column
      and a column for each waveform. You must provide a valid output file path.
    * **PNG**: Exports a plot of each waveform as a separate PNG image file. You
      must provide a path to an output directory.
    * **PCSSP XML**: Exports the data into the PCSSP XML format.

2.  **Time Options**: Define the time points at which the waveforms will be
    evaluated. This is required for all export types except PNG with the "Default"
    option.

    * **Default** (only when exporting to PNG): Each waveform is plotted using its own automatically
      determined time array.
    * **Linspace**: Creates a linearly spaced time array from a **Start** time,
      **Stop** time, and the **Number of points**.
    * **CSV File**: Upload a CSV file containing a single row of comma-separated
      time values.
    * **Manual**: Manually enter a comma-separated list of time values (e.g.
      ``0, 0.5, 1.0``).

Editing Configuration
---------------------

The main interface is divided into a sidebar for selection and a tabbed area for
viewing and editing. The workflow involves selecting waveforms in the sidebar and
then using the tabs to view or modify them.

Waveform Selection Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The waveforms in the configuration are organized into hierarchical structure of groups,
For more details on the file format, see the :ref:`YAML File Format <yaml_format>` section.
This structure is visualized in the sidebar of the GUI.

For each group, a row of buttons provides several actions:

* |add_waveform_icon| **(Add new waveform)**: Creates a new, empty waveform within that group.
* |remove_waveform_icon| **(Remove selected waveforms)**: Deletes all selected waveforms within that
  group.
* |add_group_icon| **(Add new group)**: Creates a new subgroup.
* |select_all_icon| **(Select all)**: Selects all waveforms in the group (only available in the
  "View Waveforms" tab).
* |deselect_all_icon| **(Deselect all)**: Deselects all waveforms in the group.
* |remove_group_icon| **(Remove this group)**: Deletes the group and all its contents (waveforms and
  subgroups).
* |rename_waveform_icon| **(Rename waveform)**: Renames the single selected waveform in that group.


Filtering Waveforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To quickly find specific waveforms in large configurations, a filter bar is
available at the top of the waveform selector sidebar.

As you type into the "Filter waveforms..." box, the waveforms will be filtered based on 
whether the names contain the typed text. The search is case-insensitive.

To return to the tree view, you can either clear the text from the filter bar
manually or click the **Clear filter** (|clear_filter_icon|) icon that appears next to it.

   for :ref:`this example configuration <example_config>`

Viewing and Editing Waveforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GUI provides two main tabs for working with waveforms: **View Waveforms**, and **Edit Waveforms**.

The **View Waveforms** tab allows you to plot multiple waveforms on the same axes
for comparison. In this mode, you can select multiple waveforms from the sidebar, 
and they will be displayed in the plot on the right.

The **Edit Waveforms** tab is designed for modifying a single, selected waveform.
This view is split into two sections:

* **Code Editor**: The YAML definition for the selected waveform is displayed here.
  You can directly edit the text, and the plot will update automatically. If
  there are syntax errors or inconsistencies in the waveform logic, an error or
  warning message will appear below the editor, and annotations will highlight
  the problematic lines.

.. figure:: images/gui/editor.png

   Example of an nbi waveform, showing the code editor containing the waveform YAML defition, 
   and the plot showing the waveform currently being editted.

* **Interactive Plot**: For waveforms with ``piecewise`` tendencies, the waveform can be
  updated by interacting with the plot. All changes are instantly reflected in the YAML code. 
  To interact with the plot, ensure you enable the **Point Draw Tool** (|point_draw_tool|). 
  You can:

  * **Add Points**: Click anywhere on the plot to add a new point. Note: it is not 
    possible to interactively add points before a piecewise tendency, or between two
    different piecewise tendencies.
  * **Move Points**: Select one or more point and drag to change their time and
    value.
  * **Remove Points**: Select one or more points and press **Backspace**.

Editing Global Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Edit Global Properties** tab allows you to configure settings that apply to
the entire configuration. Changing these updates the global properties
of the configuration. Information about the avilable properties can be found in the 
:ref:`Global properties <global_properties>` section.

.. figure:: images/gui/global_properties.png

   Example showing how to set the global properties

Plasma Shape Editor
-------------------

The Plasma Shape Editor provides an interactive interface for running the 
`NICE <https://gitlab.inria.fr/blfauger/nice>`__ (Newton direct and Inverse Computation 
for Equilibrium) solver. This allows you to design and analyze plasma equilibria by 
either specifying a desired shape and finding the necessary coil currents (Inverse Mode) 
or by providing coil currents and calculating the resulting plasma shape (Direct Mode).

The interface is primarily divided into two sections: a large plotting area on the left 
that displays the machine geometry and equilibrium results, and a control panel on the 
right with various configuration options.

.. figure:: images/gui/plasma_shape_editor.png

   Overview of the Plasma Shape Editor

Operating Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NICE can be run in two modes, which can be selected using the radio buttons at the top 
of the control panel:

* **Inverse Mode**: You define a target plasma shape and properties, and NICE calculates 
  the required coil currents to achieve this equilibrium. You can also choose to 
  fix the current in a subset of coils.
* **Direct Mode**: You specify the currents for all coils, and NICE 
  calculates the resulting plasma equilibrium.

At the top of the control panel, you'll find **Run** and **Stop** buttons to start and 
terminate the NICE simulation. A terminal window below these buttons displays live 
output from NICE.

Configuration Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The control panel on the right contains several collapsible option menus, each dedicated 
to a specific part of the configuration. A warning icon (⚠️) next to a option title 
indicates that required information for this section is missing, and needs to be updated 
for NICE to run.

The following option menus are available, these will be explained in detail in the 
sections below:

* **NICE Configuration**: Required NICE configuration parameters.
* **Plotting Parameters**: Configuration for the plot.
* **Plasma Shape**: Target plasma shape when running NICE in **Inverse Mode**.
* **Plasma Properties**: Plasma characteristics, such as plasma current and p' / ff' profiles.
* **Coil Currents**: The currents through the active field coils.

NICE Configuration
""""""""""""""""""
This is where you set up the core parameters for NICE and provide the necessary machine description files.

This section includes settings for:

* The file paths to the NICE executables for both *inverse* and *direct* modes.
  These correspond to the executables that were built in :ref:`this section <installing_nice>`. For example:
  ``path/to/nice/run/nice_imas_inv_muscle3`` and ``path/to/nice/run/nice_imas_dir_muscle3``
  for the inverse mode and direct mode executable paths respectively.
* Any environment variables that NICE requires. These are stored as a dictionary of strings.
  For example: ``{'LD_LIBRARY_PATH': '/home/user/.local/lib'}``
* The IMAS URIs for the machine descriptions.
* The level of detail in the output logs generated by the solver.

.. note::

  The settings in the NICE Configuration section are **persistent**. They are 
  automatically saved to a configuration file (by default located in ``$HOME/.config/waveform_editor.yaml``) 
  and will be reloaded each time you start the application.

Plotting Parameters
"""""""""""""""""""
This contains options to change the visualization in the plotting area.
You can show/hide all the different plotting elements, and choose how many contour levels
to use for plotting the poloidal flux.

Plasma Shape
""""""""""""
This option is **only available in Inverse Mode** and is used to define the target 
plasma boundary. There are three methods for specifying the shape:

* **Equilibrium IDS outline**: Loads the plasma boundary outline directly from a 
  specified time slice of an existing `equilibrium` IDS.
* **Parameterized**: Generates a parameterization of the shape based on a set of 
  geometric parameters.
* **Equilibrium IDS Gaps**: Loads `gaps
  <https://imas-data-dictionary.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/ids/equilibrium.html#equilibrium-time_slice-boundary-gap>`__ 
  from an `equilibrium` IDS. The distance value from the reference point can be changed from the UI.

Plasma Properties
"""""""""""""""""
This contains settings for configurating the plasma's physical properties.
You can either load them from an existing equilibrium or define them manually.

* **Equilibrium IDS**: Loads the plasma current (`Ip`), reference major radius (`R0`), 
  toroidal field (`B0`), and the p' and ff' profiles from a specified time slice of an `equilibrium` IDS.
* **Manual**: Allows you to set `Ip`, `R0`, and `B0` manually. The p' and ff' profiles 
  are configured using the **alpha**, **beta**, and **gamma** parameters as described below.

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   p'(\psi_N) &\propto \frac{\beta}{r_0} \big(1 - \psi_N^\alpha\big)^\gamma \\
   ff'(\psi_N) &\propto (1 - \beta) \mu_0 r_0 \big(1 - \psi_N^\alpha\big)^\gamma
   \end{aligned}

Here, :math:`\psi_N` is the normalized poloidal magnetic flux, :math:`r_0` is the major 
radius of the vacuum chamber, and :math:`\mu_0` is constant magnetic permeability of vacuum.
Note, the actual p' and ff' will be scaled by NICE to satisfy the required total plasma current Ip.

The parameter **beta** is related to the poloidal beta, whereas **alpha** and **gamma** 
describe the peakage of the current profile. See equation 2.11 in `B. Cédric, et al. "CÉDRÈS: a free-boundary solver 
for the Grad–Shafranov equation." (2014) <https://inria.hal.science/hal-01088772/file/CedresRefPaper.pdf>`_

Coil Currents
"""""""""""""
This allows you to view and control the currents in the coils defined in the `pf_active` IDS. 
Its behavior changes depending on the operating mode:

* In **Inverse Mode**, each coil has a checkbox and a slider. If you check the box next 
  to a coil, its current is fixed to the value set by the slider. Unchecked coils are 
  free to change and their currents will be calculated by NICE. After a successful run 
  in Inverse Mode, the sliders will be updated to show the calculated currents.
* In **Direct Mode**, the sliders for all coils are enabled. You must use these sliders to provide the input current for every coil.

You can save the coil currents to waveforms at a chosen export time. The coil current
values will be stored in a :ref:`piecewise-linear-tendency` at the end of the
corresponding waveforms (for example: ``pf_active/coil(1)/current/data``). This allows for a 
convenient construction of a waveform by iteratively executing the following:

#. Configure the plasma parameters and shape.
#. Execute NICE to calculate the set of coil currents.
#. Set an export time value, and append the calculated values to their respective waveforms.
