# Waveform Editor

The Waveform Editor is a Python tool for creating and managing 1D time-dependent data
called waveforms. It utilizes a human-readable, text-based file format where waveforms
are described using descriptive tendencies, such as sine waves or linear ramps. The
Waveform Editor includes a GUI for interactive creation, editing, and organization of
waveforms.

## Development Status 

This project is currently under active development. While a functional prototype and
core features are already implemented, additional features, usability improvements, and
integrations are in progress. The following features are planned for the coming months:
- UI usability enhancements
- Integration of Plasma Shape Editor: construct waveforms directly from equilibrium

## Install

To install the waveform editor, run the following:

```bash
# On SDCC, ensure you have loaded the IMAS-Python module:
# module load IMAS-Python
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install waveform-editor
```

More detailed instructions for installing can be found on [Read the
Docs](https://waveform-editor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html).

## Usage

The GUI can be launched using:
```bash
waveform-editor gui 
```

Or the CLI can be launched using:
```bash
waveform-editor --help
```

## Docs

The documentation is autogenerated from the source using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/)
and can be found on [Read the Docs](https://waveform-editor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Alternatively, you can generate the documentation yourself:
```bash
pip install .[docs]
make -C docs html
```
