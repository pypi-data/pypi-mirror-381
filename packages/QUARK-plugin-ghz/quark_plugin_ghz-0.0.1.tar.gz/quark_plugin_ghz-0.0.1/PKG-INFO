# QUARK-plugin-ghz

This QUARK plugin provides a QUARK-module ("GHZ") which in combination with some mappings allows to use a GHZ (Greenberger Horne Zeilinger) circuit to be used as circuit within QUARK for testing purposes.

The mapping "QasmGHZCircuit" takes the preprocess output from GHZ and creates a circuit in the QASM format.

QUARK-plugin-myqlm provides a mapping into some myqlm specific representation.
