Orange3 Textable Prototypes
===========================

Textable Prototypes is an open-source add-on for Orange Canvas 3. It collects text analysis widgets that couldn't be included in the core Textable distribution for various reasons (notably because they introduce dependencies to third-party packages, or simply because they're not yet production-ready), but that may still be found useful by Orange Canvas/Textable users.

The project is brought to the community by the department of language and information sciences (SLI) at the University of Lausanne. It is hosted at `<https://github.com/axanthos/orange3-textable-prototypes>`_, and the documentation can be found at `<http://orange3-textable-prototypes.readthedocs.io/>`_.
