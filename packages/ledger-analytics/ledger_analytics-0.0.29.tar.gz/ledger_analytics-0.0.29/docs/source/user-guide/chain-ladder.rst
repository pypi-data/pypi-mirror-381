Chain Ladder Model (``ChainLadder``)
------------------------------------

The chain ladder method is a simple loss development technique that assumes that the ratio of 
ultimate losses to current losses is the same for all accident periods. Our chain ladder *model* is 
based on the chain ladder method, and is implemented by the ``ChainLadder`` model type. Mathematically,
the base ``ChainLadder`` model is expressed as:

.. math::

    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            y_{ij} &\sim \mathrm{Gamma(\mu_{ij}, \sigma_{ij}^2)},  \quad{\forall j \in (1, \tau]}\\
            \mu_{ij} &= ATA_{j - 1} y_{ij-1}\\
            \sigma_{\text{noise},j} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\sigma_{\text{noise},\text{loc}}, \sigma_{\text{noise},\text{scale}})\\
            \log \bf{ATA}_{1:M - 1} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(ATA_{\text{loc}}, ATA_{\text{scale}})\\
            \sigma_{\text{int}} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\sigma_{\text{int}, \text{loc}}, \sigma_{\text{int}, \text{scale}})\\
            \sigma_{\text{slope}} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\sigma_{\text{slope}, \text{loc}}, \sigma_{\text{slope}, \text{scale}})\\
            ATA_{\text{loc}} &= 0\\
            ATA_{\text{scale}} &= 5\\
            \sigma_{\text{int}, \text{loc}} &= 0\\
            \sigma_{\text{int}, \text{scale}} &= 3\\
            \sigma_{\text{slope}, \text{loc}} &= -0.6\\
            \sigma_{\text{slope}, \text{scale}} &= 0.3\\
            \sigma_{\text{noise},\text{loc}} &= 0\\
            \sigma_{\text{noise},\text{scale}} &= 0.5
        \end{split}
    \end{align}

where :math:`\bf{ATA}` is a vector of *age-to-age factors* that capture how losses
change across development lags, :math:`\tau \in {2,...,M}` is an integer chosen by an analyst 
that indicates how many development lags should be used to fit the model to, and 
:math:`\mathrm{Gamma(\mu, \sigma^2)}` is the mean-variance parameterization of the 
Gamma distribution. In practice, :math:`\tau` is determined by preprocessing (i.e. clipping) the 
triangle before fitting. 

Model Fit Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``ChainLadder`` model is fit using the following API call: 

.. code-block:: python

    model = client.development_model.create(
        triangle=...,
        name="example_name",
        model_type="ChainLadder",
        config={ # default model_config
            "loss_definition": "paid",
            "loss_family": "gamma",
            "use_linear_noise": True,
            "use_multivariate": False,
            "line_of_business": None,
            "informed_priors_version": None,
            "priors": None, # see defaults below
            "recency_decay": 1.0,
            "seed": None
        }
    )

The ``ChainLadder`` model accepts the following configuration parameters in ``config``:

- ``loss_definition``: Name of loss field to model in the underlying triangle (e.g., ``"reported"``, ``"paid"``, or ``"incurred"``). Defaults to ``"paid"``.
- ``loss_family``: Outcome distribution family (e.g., ``"gamma"``, ``"lognormal"``, or ``""normal"``). Defaults to ``"gamma"``.
- ``use_linear_noise``: Whether to use the linear noise variance function as specified in the ``ChainLadder`` equation above. Defaults to ``False``. If set to ``True``, random intercepts are dropped for each development lag such that the variance function becomes: 

.. math::

    \begin{align}
        \sigma_{ij}^2 &= \exp(\sigma_{\text{int}} + \sigma_{\text{slope}} j + \log(y_{ij-1}))
    \end{align}

- ``use_multivariate``: Whether to use a industry-informed multivariate normal prior distribution on the age-to-age factors to leverage industry ATA means and covariances across development lags when fitting to the given triangle. Defaults to ``False``. If set to ``True``, ``line_of_business`` and ``informed_priors_version`` must also be specified. Cannot be used with ``use_linear_noise=False``.
- ``line_of_business``: Line of business that the input triangle belongs to. Supported lines include: ``["CA", "MC", "MO", "OO", "PC", "PO", "PP", "SL", "WC"]``. Abbreviations map to the following lines: 

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "CA": "Commercial Auto Liability",
        "MC": "Medical Liability: Claims Made",
        "MO": "Medical Liability: Occurrence",
        "OO": "Other Liability: Occurrence",
        "PC": "Product Liability: Claims Made",
        "PO": "Product Liability: Occurrence",
        "PP": "Private Passenger Auto",
        "SL": "Special Liability",
        "WC": "Workers' Compensation"
    }

- ``informed_priors_version``: Version of the industry-informed priors to use when fitting the model (when ``use_multivariate=True``). Supported versions currently only include: ``"2022"``. Specify as ``"latest"`` to always use the most up-to-date priors available. Defaults to ``None``.
- ``priors``: Dictionary of prior distributions to use for model fitting. Default priors are: 

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "ata__loc": 0.0,
        "ata__scale": 5.0,
        "sigma_slope__loc": -0.6,
        "sigma_slope__scale": 0.3,
        "sigma_intercept__loc": 0.0,
        "sigma_intercept__scale": 3.0,
        "sigma_noise__sigma_scale": 0.5, # for use_linear_noise=False
    }

- ``recency_decay``: Likelihood weight decay to down-weight data from older evaluation dates. Defaults to ``1.0``, which means no decay. If set to a value between ``0.0`` and ``1.0``, the likelihood of older evaluation dates will be downweighted by a geometric decay function with factor ``recency_decay``. See :ref:`geometric-decay` for more information.
- ``seed``: Random seed for model fitting.


Model Predict Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``ChainLadder`` model is used to predict future losses using the following API call:

.. code-block:: python

    predictions = model.development_model.predict(
        triangle=...,
        config={ # default config
            "max_dev_lag": None,
            "include_process_noise": True,
        }
        target_triangle=None,
    )

Above, ``triangle`` is the triangle to use to start making predictions from and ``target_triangle`` is the triangle to make predictions on. For most use-cases, ``triangle`` will be the same triangle that was used in model fitting, and setting ``target_triangle=None`` will create a squared version of the modeled triangle. However, decoupling ``triangle`` and ``target_triangle`` means users could train the model on one triangle, and then make predictions starting from and/or on a different triangle. By default, predictions will be made out to the maximum development lag in ``triangle``, but users can also set ``max_dev_lag`` in the configuration directly.

The ``ChainLadder`` prediction behavior can be further changed with configuration parameters in ``config``:

- ``max_dev_lag``: Maximum development lag to predict out to. If not specified, the model will predict out to the maximum development lag in ``triangle``. Note that ``ChainLadder`` can only generative predictions out to the maximum development lag in the training triangle, as there is no mechanism in the model to extrapolate out age-to-age beyond the training data.
- ``include_process_noise``: Whether to include process noise in the predictions. Defaults to ``True``, which generates posterior predictions from the mathematical model as specified above. If set to ``False``, the model will generate predictions without adding process noise to the predicted losses. Referring to the mathematical expression above, this equates to obtaining the expectation :math:`\mu_{ij}` as predictions as oppposed to :math:`y_{ij}`.
