# WhiffPy 🐍💨  
**WhiffPy** is a smart Python code explainer and error analyzer designed for beginners, educators, and anyone who wants to understand Python code more deeply. It analyzes code, explains its structure in plain English, and provides actionable, friendly error messages.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Beginner-friendly explanations of code structure using **Python's AST**  
- Human-readable **error analysis with suggestions** for common mistakes  
- **Safe code execution** with output and error capture  
- Flexible **CLI**: analyze files or code snippets, output as text or JSON, save results  
- Easy to extend: add new error hints or code patterns

## 📦 Installation  

### Using Poetry (recommended for development)  
Ensure you have **Python 3.9+** and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.  

```sh
# Clone the repository and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/your-username/whiffpy.git
cd whiffpy
poetry install
````

### Using pip (for general usage)

If you’ve installed WhiffPy locally using pip, you can run commands directly:

```sh
pip install whiffpy
whiffpy path/to/file.py
```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Command Line Interface

Analyze a Python file:

```sh
whiffpy path/to/file.py
```

Analyze a code snippet directly:

```sh
whiffpy --code "print(1+1)"
```

Explain code structure only (no execution):

```sh
whiffpy path/to/file.py --explain-only
```

Output as JSON:

```sh
whiffpy path/to/file.py --json
```

Save output to a file:

```sh
whiffpy path/to/file.py --save result.txt
```

### Python API

```python
from whiffpy import analyze

code = "x = 1 / 0"
report = analyze(code)
print(report)
```
