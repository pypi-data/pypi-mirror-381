# Welcome

Welcome! This site is your practical guide to developing custom device drivers and integrating them with the [CGSE](https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/cgse) framework. Through clear examples and step-by-step instructions, you'll learn how to build, test, and extend your own drivers using the CGSE-DUMMY project.

## What is the CGSE-DUMMY?

CGSE-DUMMY is a reference implementation and simulation tool designed to demonstrate how to develop and integrate 
external device drivers with the [CGSE](https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/cgse) (Common-EGSE) framework. It provides a 
fully functional example of a device driver and control server, including both synchronous and asynchronous variants,
as well as simulated device behavior. The CGSE-DUMMY project is intended for developers who want to learn best 
practices  for device integration, test their own extensions, or explore the CGSE architecture in a safe, sandboxed 
environment.
