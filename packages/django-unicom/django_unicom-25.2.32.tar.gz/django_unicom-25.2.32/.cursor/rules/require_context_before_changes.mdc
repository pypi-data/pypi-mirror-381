- Always scan and reference relevant model/structure definitions before generating code and any involved functions and models before using them.
- If using classes, database models, or domain-specific code (e.g. Django models), preview their definitions first.
- If relevant context is not already part of the prompt, ask: “Do you want me to inspect these definitions before proceeding?”
