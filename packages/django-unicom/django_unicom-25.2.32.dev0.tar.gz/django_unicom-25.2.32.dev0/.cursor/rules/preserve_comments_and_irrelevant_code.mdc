- Do **not** remove or refactor functions, files, comments, or documentation unless **explicitly** requested.
- Before altering any code block, analyze its purpose and ask a confirming question if unsure why it's there.
- Preserve unrelated code and comments, especially those marked with `TODO`, `FIXME`, or doc comments.
