- Before writing new code or modifying existing parts, analyze the surrounding codebase to understand the structure, naming conventions, architectural patterns, and formatting.
- Align new code to match these conventions unless specifically instructed otherwise.
- Avoid introducing unfamiliar abstractions, styles, or folder structures unless required or explicitly requested.
- The goal is consistency, clarity, and maintainability across the codebase.
