Asynchronous Python client for the open datasets of Brussel (Belgium).

## About

A python package with which you can retrieve data from the Open Data Platform of Brussel via [their API][api]. This package was initially created to only retrieve parking data from the API, but the code base is made in such a way that it is easy to extend for other datasets from the same platform.

## Installation

```bash
pip install brussel
```

## Datasets

You can read the following datasets with this package:

- [Parking spaces for disabled / Parkings pour personnes handicap√©es][disabled_parkings] (973 locations)
- [Public parkings / Parkings publics][park_and_rides] (27 locations)

## Example

```python
import asyncio

from brussel import ODPBrussel


async def main() -> None:
    """Show example on using the Open Data API client."""
    async with ODPBrussel() as client:
        garages = await client.garages(limit=10)
        disabled_parkings = await client.disabled_parkings(limit=10)
        print(garages)
        print(disabled_parkings)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Use cases

[NIPKaart.nl][nipkaart]

A website that provides insight into where disabled parking spaces are, based
on data from users and municipalities. Operates mainly in the Netherlands, but
also has plans to process data from abroad.

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Setting up development environment

The simplest way to begin is by utilizing the [Dev Container][devcontainer]
feature of Visual Studio Code or by opening a CodeSpace directly on GitHub.

[![Open in Dev Containers][devcontainer-shield]][devcontainer]

This Python project relies on [Poetry][poetry] as its dependency manager,
providing comprehensive management and control over project dependencies.

You need at least:

- Python 3.11+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

### Installation

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

_Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages_.

### Pre-commit

This repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. To setup the pre-commit check, run:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

And to run all checks and tests manually, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing

It uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) as the test framework. To run the tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

To update the [syrupy](https://github.com/tophat/syrupy) snapshot tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest --snapshot-update
```
