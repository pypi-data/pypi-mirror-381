# Typed Linq Collections

Linq for Python with full type annotions. 
Query any built in Iterable or use one of the queryable collections that are drop in replacements for standard collections.

- **Rich Query API**: Almost the full Enumerable set of operators from .net gives excellent support for filtering, mapping, grouping, and more in a fluent API
- **Comprehensive type annotions**: Gives you full autocomplete and static error analysis if using pyright with vscode or PyCharm. In vscode refactoring within the lambdas work like a charm
- **Comprehensive test suite**: More than 900 tests covering every single line and code branch
- **Comprehensive docstrings**: Every method and class is documented, giving excellent discoverability of functionality in any modern IDE/editor.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Memory efficient query execution with deferred evaluation for every operation other than the to_* methods which create new collections 
- **Drop-in compatible collection types**: Collection types that seamlessly replace and interoperate with standard Python collections. QList, QSet, QDict etc
- **Numeric Specializations**: Dedicated types for `int`, `float`, `Decimal`, and `Fraction` collections
- **Extensible Design**: QIterable is an abstract class/mixin that can be subclassed by any Iterable type to add full querying capabilities

## Quick Start

```python
from typed_linq_collections.collections.q_list import QList
from typed_linq_collections.q_iterable import query


fruits = ("apple", "apricot", "mango", "melon", "peach", "pineapple")
def test_querying_built_in_collections() -> None:
    fruits_by_first_character = (query(fruits)
                                 .group_by(lambda fruit: fruit[0])
                                 .where(lambda group: group.key in {"a", "p"})
                                 .to_list())

    assert fruits_by_first_character == [['apple', 'apricot'], ['peach', 'pineapple']]

def test_querying_with_queryable_collections() -> None:
    fruits_by_first_character = (QList(fruits)
                                 .group_by(lambda fruit: fruit[0])
                                 .where(lambda group: group.key in {"a", "p"})
                                 .to_list())

    assert fruits_by_first_character == [['apple', 'apricot'], ['peach', 'pineapple']]

def test_numeric_operations() -> None:
    total_lenght_of_fruits = (query(fruits)
                              .select(len)
                              .as_ints() # get's you a QIntIterable with numeric operations support. typed so that it is only available on a QIterable[int]
                              .sum())

    assert total_lenght_of_fruits == 36
```

## Collection Types

### Core Collections
Drop in replacements for the built in collections.
- **`QList[T]`** - Queryable list (mutable sequence)
- **`QSequence[T]`** - Queryable immutable sequence
- **`QSet[T]`** - Queryable set (mutable)
- **`QFrozenSet[T]`** - Queryable frozen set (immutable)
- **`QDict[K, V]`** - Queryable dictionary
- **`QDefaultDict[K, V]`** - Queryable default dictionary

### Numeric Collections
Specialized collections with additional numeric operations:

- **`QIntIterable`** - For integer collections
- **`QFloatIterable`** - For float collections
- **`QDecimalIterable`** - For Decimal collections
- **`QFractionIterable`** - For Fraction collections
- 
and so on with equivalents for QList, QSet, QDict, QFrozenSet, QDefaultDict.
