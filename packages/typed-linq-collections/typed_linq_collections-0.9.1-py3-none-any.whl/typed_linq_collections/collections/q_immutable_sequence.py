    """An immutable sequence that provides LINQ-style query operations with guaranteed ordering.

    QImmutableSequence offers the functionality of an ordered, indexed collection that cannot
    be modified after creation. It provides O(1) indexing and maintains element order while
    implementing the full QIterable interface for LINQ-style operations.

    This class is ideal for scenarios requiring immutable data structures with efficient
    indexed access, such as functional programming patterns, caching scenarios, or when
    you need to ensure data integrity across multiple operations.

    Inheritance:
    - Inherits from ImmutableSequence[TItem] for immutable sequence operations
    - Implements QSequence[TItem] for indexed access patterns
    - Implements QIterable[TItem] for LINQ-style query operations

    Key Features:
    - **Immutable**: Cannot be modified after creation, ensuring thread safety
    - **Indexed Access**: Supports efficient O(1) indexing and slicing operations
    - **Ordered**: Maintains insertion order consistently
    - **LINQ Operations**: Full suite of query methods returning new instances
    - **Slicing**: Slice operations return new QImmutableSequence instances
    - **Type Safety**: Maintains generic type information for compile-time safety
    - **Memory Efficient**: Optimized internal storage for immutable access patterns
