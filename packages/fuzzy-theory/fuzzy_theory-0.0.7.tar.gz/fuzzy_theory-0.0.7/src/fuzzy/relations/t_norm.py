    Dongrui Wu, and Yifan Xu, in 2021. The benefit of this method is that it is able to
    overcome the curse of dimensionality, as the scale of the rule activation no longer depends
    upon the dimensionality; "even in very high dimensional space, assuming the input feature
    vectors are properly pre-processed (z-score or zero-one normalization, etc.), we can still
    guarantee the stability of HTSK." To read more, the paper is titled:

        "Curse of Dimensionality for TSK Fuzzy Neural Networks: Explanation and Solution".
