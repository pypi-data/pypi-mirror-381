> [!NOTE]
> This plugin was developed to demonstrate [the importance of reproducible builds in the Qiskit quantum computing workflow](https://github.com/cryptohslu/reproducible-builds-quantum-computing).
> It shows that non-reproducibility in the transpilation process (specifically during the [layout stage](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/transpiler-stages#layout-stage))
> can be exploited to encode classical information into the transpiled quantum circuit. If an attacker subsequently
> gains access to the job description, this can lead to the leakage of confidential data.

A transpilation layout plugin for [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit) that demonstrates how a modified
transpilation stage can be used to hide classical information in the final transpiled quantum circuit.

The current implementation, by default, tries to encode the UTF-8 encoded string
`My secret data encoded in the transpiled circuit layout.` into the transpiled circuit.
Custom data will be used if available in `builtins.data` (see [the example](#Example) below). If data is too large to be
encoded into the given circuit, the layout plugin fallbacks to the
[`TrivialLayout`](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.passes.TrivialLayout), which maps virtual
qubits to physical qubits in the trivial way (i.e., $0\rightarrow0$, $1\rightarrow1$, etc.).

The plugin [is implemented](src/qiskit_leaky_layout/leaky_layout_plugin.py#L151) as a subclass of
[`PassManagerStagePlugin`](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin.PassManagerStagePlugin),
which uses a custom pass called [`LeakyLayout`](src/qiskit_leaky_layout/leaky_layout_plugin.py#L83). This pass is
implemented as a subclass of [`AnalysisPass`](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.AnalysisPass),
since no changes to the quantum circuit are done.

Encoded data can be recovered with the `recover_data()` function implemented in the
[decoder module](src/qiskit_leaky_layout/decoder.py). See [the example](#Example) below.

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/iyanmv/qiskit-leaky-layout.git
cd qiskit-leaky-layout
pip install .
```

## Example

```python
import builtins
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager
from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin import list_stage_plugins
from qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider import FakeBrisbane
from qiskit_leaky_layout.decoder import recover_data

# Check that layout plugin was installed successfully
assert "leaky_layout" in list_stage_plugins("layout")

# Fake 127-qubit backend used as target for the transpilation
backend = FakeBrisbane()

# Pass manager for the transpilation with our custom layout plugin
pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(
    optimization_level=3, backend=backend, layout_method="leaky_layout"
)

# 3-qubit GHZ circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(backend.num_qubits)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, range(1, 3))

# Uncomment to encode these bytes instead of the default message
# builtins.data = b"\x12Y\xfd$^%g\xcbf\x1b"

# Transpiled circuit
isa_qc = pm.run(qc)

# Recover data as raw bytes
recovered_default_message = recover_data(isa_qc, size_alphabet=127)[-56:]
assert (recovered_default_message == b"My secret data encoded in the transpiled circuit layout.")

# recovered_custom_message = recover_data(isa_qc, size_alphabet=127)[-10:]
# assert recovered_custom_message == b"\x12Y\xfd$^%g\xcbf\x1b"
```
