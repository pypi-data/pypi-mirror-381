# Berea: A CLI for studying Scripture

## Installation

```
pip install berea
```

## Usage
### Manage Translations

Once installed, download a Bible translation:

```
bible download KJV
```

Translations are downloaded from [github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases), which includes 140 translations across many languages. Check the [available translations](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases?tab=readme-ov-file#available-translations-140) for more information. One or more translations may be downloaded. The first download is set as the default translation for the `reference` and `search` commands described below.

Run the `config` command to manually set the default translation:

```
bible config translation BSB
```

The default translation must be set to a downloaded translation.

To delete a translation, run the following command:

```
bible delete KJV
```

### Reference

The `reference` command looks up a passage in the Bible, eg. a specific verse like so:

```
bible reference john 3 16
```

`reference` (the default command) is executed if no other command is specified:

```
bible john 3 16
```

Similarly, reference a passage:

```
bible matthew 5 1-11
```

Reference a chapter:

```
bible psalm 117
```

Reference an entire book:

```
bible 3john
```

The default translation is used unless otherwise specified via the `-t, --translation` flag:

```
bible john 3 16 -t BSB
```

Downloaded translations are displayed in the `--translation` flag description of the `reference` help text:

```
bible reference --help
```

Verse numbers can be toggled on using the `-n, --numbers` flag.

```
bible matthew 5 1-11 -n
```

The output format is specified using the `-f, --format` flag (default: `txt` or plaintext).

```
bible matthew 5 1-11 -f md
```

### Search

The `search` command finds all occurrences of a phrase throughout the Bible:

```
bible search 'prince of peace'
```

Translation is specified via the `-t, --translation` flag:

```
bible search 'prince of peace' -t BSB
```

A phrase can be searched in a particular book:

```
bible search martha john
```

or a specific chapter:

```
bible search justification rom 4
```

Search a phrase within the New Testament:

```
bible search ghost -NT
```

or the Old Testament:

```
bible search 'holy spirit' -OT
```

For large results sets, consider saving the output to a file:

```
bible search fulfilled -NT >> search_fulfilled.txt
```
