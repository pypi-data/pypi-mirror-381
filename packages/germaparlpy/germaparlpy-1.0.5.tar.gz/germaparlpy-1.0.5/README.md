The GermaParlPy Python package provides functionality to deserialize, serialize, manage, and query the GermaParlTEI[^1]
 corpus and derived corpora.

The GermaParlTEI corpus comprises the plenary protocols of the German Bundestag (parliament), encoded in XML according to the TEI standard. The current version covers the first 19 legislative periods, encompassing transcribed speeches from the Bundestag's constituent session on 7 September 1949 to the final sitting of the Angela Merkel era in 2021. This makes it a valuable resource for research in various scientific disciplines.

For detailed information on the library, visit the [official website](https://nolram567.github.io/GermaParlPy/).

## Use Cases

Potential use cases range from the examination of research questions in political science, history or linguistics to the compilation of training data sets for AI.

In addition, this library makes it possible to access the GermaParl corpus in Python and apply powerful NLP libraries such as spacy or gensim to it. Previously, the corpus could only be accessed using the PolMineR package in the R programming language.

## Installation

GermaParlPy is available on PyPi:

```sh
pip install germaparlpy
