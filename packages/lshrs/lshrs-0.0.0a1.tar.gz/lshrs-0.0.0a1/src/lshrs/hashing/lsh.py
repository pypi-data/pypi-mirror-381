    Function to implement Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for signatures.

    Input:
        - signature: A list of binary or hyperplane encoded signatures.
        - r: The number of rows in each band.
        - signature_type: Type of encoding used (e.g., OneHotEncoding or
          HyperplaneEncoding).

    Output:
        - buckets: A dictionary where keys are bands and values are lists of
          document IDs that fall into those bands.
