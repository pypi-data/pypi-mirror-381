## Installation

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Hereâ€™s how to set up the development environment from scratch.

### 1. Install `pipx` (Recommended)

`pipx` is a tool to help you install and run Python applications in isolated environments. It's the recommended way to install `poetry`.

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

After running this, you may need to restart your terminal for the `pipx` command to be available.

### 2. Install Poetry

Once `pipx` is installed, you can use it to install Poetry:

```bash
pipx install poetry
```

### 3. Set Up the Project

Now, you can set up the project itself.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mxngjxa/lshrs.git
    cd lshrs
    ```

2.  **macOS Prerequisite: Install `gfortran`**
    If you are on macOS, you will need to install a Fortran compiler for the `scipy` dependency to build correctly. The easiest way is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
    ```bash
    brew install gfortran
    ```

3.  **Create a local virtual environment.**
    It's recommended to create a virtual environment in the project's root directory.
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

4.  **Configure Poetry to use the local virtual environment.**
    This step ensures that Poetry installs dependencies into the `.venv` directory you just created.
    ```bash
    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
    ```

5.  **Install dependencies.**
    Finally, use Poetry to install the project's dependencies.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    This will install all the dependencies defined in the `pyproject.toml` file.

## Usage

You can find basic and advanced usage examples in the `examples` directory.

- [`basic_usage.py`](examples/basic_usage.py)
- [`advanced_usage.py`](examples/advanced_usage.py)

## Development

This project uses `ruff` for linting and formatting.

-   **Linting:** To check for any style issues or errors, run the following command:
    ```bash
    poetry run ruff check src
    ```
-   **Formatting:** To automatically fix any issues that `ruff` finds, run this command:
    ```bash
    poetry run ruff check --fix src
    ```

## Core Orchestration of the `lshrs` Library

This directory contains the source code for the `lshrs` library, a Python-based recommendation system using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH).

### Modules

The `lshrs` library is organized into the following modules:

- [Core](#core)
- [Encoding](#encoding)
- [Hashing](#hashing)
- [Preprocessing](#preprocessing)
- [Utils](#utils)

---

#### Core

The `core` module contains the main components for running the LSH recommendation system.

- **`tfidf.py`**: Implements TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.

---

#### Hashing

The `hashing` module contains different hashing algorithms used in LSH.
