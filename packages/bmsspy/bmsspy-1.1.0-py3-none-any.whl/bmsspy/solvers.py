    """
    Function:

    - A Full BMSSP-style shortest path solver.
    - Return a dictionary of various path information including:
        - `id_path`: A list of node ids in the order they are visited
        - `path`: A list of node dictionaries (lat + long) in the order they are visited

    Required Arguments:

    - `graph`:
        - Type: list of dictionaries
    - `origin_id`
        - Type: int
        - What: The id of the origin node from the graph dictionary to start the shortest path from
    - `destination_id`
        - Type: int | None
        - What: The id of the destination node from the graph dictionary to end the shortest path at
        - Note: If None, returns the distance matrix and predecessor list for the origin node
        - Note: If provided, returns the shortest path [origin_id, ..., destination_id] and its length

    Optional Arguments:

    - None

    Returns:

    - A dictionary with the following keys
        - `origin_id`: The id of the origin node
        - `destination_id`: The id of the destination node (or None)
        - `predecessor`: The predecessor list for path reconstruction
        - `distance_matrix`: The distance matrix from the origin node to all other nodes
        - `path`: The shortest path from origin_id to destination_id (or None)
        - `length`: The length of the shortest path from origin_id to destination_id (or None)
