# SWOOPS Optimization GUI

## Setup, Workflows, Orchestrate, Optimize, Plotting, Surrogates

### Author: Jason Krist

### Date: October 1st, 2025

## Description

SWOOPS is an in-progress Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed for parametric optimization. Each letter of SWOOPS stands for a feature set that is within the scope of the tool. [Swoops](https://www.mariowiki.com/Swoop) are also the name for the bats in super mario, hence the mascot for the tool is a swoop named Zippy, which is an homage to the Microsoft Office Assistance [Clippy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant).

SWOOPS is a culmination of everything I want in an optimization GUI. I have tired of the current state of optimization tooling: The high tech debt and learning curve of custom tools. The expense, inconfigurability, and vendor lock-in of COTS tools. And the unfriendly user experience across the board. My conclusions and design philosophy are summarized in the "Core Tenets" section below.

## Install

```
pip install swoops
```

## Usage (Incomplete)

python test_app.py

Add more GUI usage steps and images here.

### Python In-Line Usage (Incomplete)

Probably don't need this section.

### Command Line Usage (Incomplete)

swoops [-h] [-file FILE] [-b] 

## Core Tenets

1. Democratize Optimization
1. Prioritize User Experience
1. Seamless Automation
1. Make Lasting Contributions
1. Free and Open Source Core Program
1. Modularity is a Must
1. Encourage Community Collaboration

## Roadmap

### Complete

1. Backend data structures which can represent most optimization setups
1. Widgets
    1. Docked windows - each widget is nested in a dockable window
    1. Tree View - visualize nested data structures or file system
    1. Edit Window - visualize and edit all attributes of a data structure
    1. Table View - visualize and edit a large set of entities and their attributes in a table
    1. Web View - load local HTML files (Plotly, N2 Diagram) or online web pages
    1. Plot View - load interactive Matplotlib plots
    1. Python Code Editor - text edit python scripts
1. Undoablility for Data Structure and Widget related changes (new, delete, edit)
1. Tabs which can contain different widgets and layouts
1. Rudimentary export script for swoops data structures to GEMSEO optimization format

### In Progress

1. Block Diagram Viewer
1. Get App fully functional for simple demos. This encompasses many small To-Do's.
1. Python Command Window
1. User-Friendly Python API

### Future Plans

1. File Parser for defining variable locations in input or output files
1. Create a "Library" of common tasks with drag-and-drop
1. Custom optimization orchestrator with modular optimizer interface
1. "Zippy" button opens a helper overlay for tutorials and trainings
1. Improve interoperability with [GEMSEO](https://gemseo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), [OpenMDAO](https://openmdao.org/newdocs/versions/latest/main.html#), [Pymoo](https://pymoo.org/), and possible [Philote](https://mdo-standards.github.io/Philote-MDO/intro.html) and [SUAVE](https://suave.stanford.edu/)
