# SWOOPS Optimization GUI

## Setup, Workflows, Orchestrate, Optimize, Plot, Surrogates

#### Author: Jason Krist

#### Date: October 1st, 2025

## Description

SWOOPS is an in-progress Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed for parametric optimization. Each letter of SWOOPS stands for a feature set that is within the scope of the tool. [Swoops](https://www.mariowiki.com/Swoop) are also the name for the bats in super mario, hence the mascot for the tool is a swoop named Zippy, which is an homage to the Microsoft Office Assistance [Clippy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant).

SWOOPS is a culmination of everything I want in an optimization GUI. I am not happy with the current state of optimization interfaces:

- custom tools have high tech debt and steep learning curves
- COTS tools are expensive, lack necessary configurability, and prioritize supporting tools in their ecosystem
- COTS tools have architectures which make interoperability with open source optimization frameworks difficult
- open source frameworks have little to no GUIs
- unfriendly user experiences across the board

These experiences have lead me to the "Core Tenets"  of SWOOPS below.

## Core Tenets

1. Democratize Optimization
1. Prioritize User Experience
1. Seamless Automation
1. Make Lasting Contributions
1. Free and Open Source Core Program
1. Modularity is a Must
1. Encourage Community Collaboration

## Feature Sets

1. Setup - prepare files or processes for optimization, which includes file parsers and workflow templates
1. Workflows - specify tasks, inputs, outputs, and dependencies of a workflow
1. Orchestrate - export and execute a workflow. See progress as it completes.
1. Optimize - specify constraints, objectives, algorithms, and check optimization progress as it runs
1. Plot - create user-defined plots from existing data sets or optimization results
1. Surrogates - create and test surrogate models for utilizing in multi-fidelity optimization

## Architectural Choices

- Python due to the breadth of experience for develops in this field, and it is the language of choice for existing frameworks
- Primarily target desktop platform for architectural simplicity
- QT (Pyside6) chosen for being the most robust, feature rich, and cross-platform Desktop GUI Framework in Python

## Install

```
pip install swoops
```

## Usage (Incomplete)

python test_app.py

### Python In-Line Usage (Incomplete)

Probably don't need this section.

### Command Line Usage (Incomplete)

swoops [-h] [-file FILE] [-b] 

## Roadmap

#### Complete

1. Backend data structures which can represent most optimization setups
1. Widgets
    1. Docked windows - each widget is nested in a dockable window
    1. Tree View - visualize nested data structures or file system
    1. Edit Window - visualize and edit all attributes of a data structure
    1. Table View - visualize and edit a large set of entities and their attributes in a table
    1. Web View - load local HTML files (Plotly, N2 Diagram) or online web pages
    1. Plot View - load interactive Matplotlib plots
    1. Python Code Editor - text edit python scripts
1. Undoablility for Data Structure and Widget related changes (new, delete, edit)
1. Tabs which can contain different widgets and layouts
1. Rudimentary export script for swoops data structures to GEMSEO optimization format

#### In Progress

1. Block Diagram Viewer - visualize Workflow, Dependencies, and data flow
1. Get App fully functional for simple demos. This encompasses many small To-Do's
1. Python Command Window - run python commands in-session and see results

#### Future Plans

1. File Parser for defining variable locations in input or output files
1. Workflow "Templates" can be created with Empty values which are highlighted to user to complete
1. Create a "Library" of common tasks with drag-and-drop functionality
1. User-Friendly, Documented Python API
1. Custom optimization orchestrator with modular optimizer interface
1. "Zippy" button opens a helper overlay for tutorials and trainings
1. Out-of-the-Box interoperability with [GEMSEO](https://gemseo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), [OpenMDAO](https://openmdao.org/newdocs/versions/latest/main.html#), and [Pymoo](https://pymoo.org/). Potentially work on supporting [Philote](https://mdo-standards.github.io/Philote-MDO/intro.html), [CSDL](https://lsdolab.github.io/csdl/), and [SUAVE](https://suave.stanford.edu/).
