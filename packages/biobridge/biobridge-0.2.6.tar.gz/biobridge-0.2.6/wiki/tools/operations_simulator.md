# SurgicalSimulator Class

---

## Overview
The `SurgicalSimulator` class provides a simulation environment for surgical operations. It includes tools for performing operations, visualizing the process, and training in a surgical simulator. The simulator supports multiple surgical tools and provides feedback on operation success and health changes.

---

## Class Definitions

### SurgicalTool
```python
class SurgicalTool:
    def __init__(self, name: str, precision: float, damage: float):
        ...
```
- Represents a surgical tool with a name, precision, and damage value.

#### Methods
- **`get_name(self) -> str`**: Returns the name of the tool.
- **`get_precision(self) -> float`**: Returns the precision of the tool.
- **`get_damage(self) -> float`**: Returns the damage value of the tool.

---

### OperationResult
```python
class OperationResult:
    def __init__(self, success: bool, message: str, health_change: float):
        ...
```
- Represents the result of an operation, including success status, message, and health change.

#### Methods
- **`get_success(self) -> bool`**: Returns whether the operation was successful.
- **`get_message(self) -> str`**: Returns the message describing the operation result.
- **`get_health_change(self) -> float`**: Returns the health change resulting from the operation.

---

### OperationTarget
```python
class OperationTarget:
    def __init__(self, name: str, health: float):
        ...
```
- Represents the target of an operation, such as a patient or organ, with a name and health value.

#### Methods
- **`get_name(self) -> str`**: Returns the name of the target.
- **`get_health(self) -> float`**: Returns the health of the target.
- **`set_health(self, new_health: float) -> None`**: Sets the health of the target.

---

### SurgicalSimulator
```python
class SurgicalSimulator:
    def __init__(self):
        ...
```
- Provides a simulation environment for surgical operations.

#### Attributes
| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `tools` | `Dict[str, SurgicalTool]` | Dictionary of available surgical tools. |
| `font` | `pygame.font.Font` | Font for rendering text in visualizations. |

#### Methods

- **`operate(self, target: OperationTarget, tool_name: str) -> OperationResult`**
  Performs an operation on a target using a specified tool.

  - **Parameters**:
    - `target`: The target of the operation.
    - `tool_name`: The name of the tool to use.

  - **Returns**: An `OperationResult` object.

- **`print_operation(self, target: OperationTarget, tool_name: str) -> None`**
  Prints the progress and result of an operation.

  - **Parameters**:
    - `target`: The target of the operation.
    - `tool_name`: The name of the tool to use.

- **`visualize_operation(self, target: OperationTarget) -> None`**
  Visualizes an operation using Pygame.

  - **Parameters**:
    - `target`: The target of the operation.

- **`visualize_training_mode(self, target: OperationTarget) -> None`**
  Visualizes a training mode for the surgical simulator using Pygame.

  - **Parameters**:
    - `target`: The target of the operation.

- **`get_operation_data(self, target: OperationTarget) -> Dict[str, Any]`**
  Returns operation data for a target.

  - **Parameters**:
    - `target`: The target of the operation.

  - **Returns**: A dictionary containing the target name and final health.

---

## Example Usage

```python
# Initialize the SurgicalSimulator
simulator = SurgicalSimulator()

# Create an operation target
target = OperationTarget("Patient Liver", 100.0)

# Print operation progress and result
simulator.print_operation(target, "scalpel")

# Visualize an operation
simulator.visualize_operation(target)

# Visualize training mode
simulator.visualize_training_mode(target)

# Get operation data
operation_data = simulator.get_operation_data(target)
print(operation_data)
```

---

## Dependencies
- **`random`**: For simulating random events during operations.
- **`time`**: For simulating operation time.
- **`pygame`**: For visualizing operations and training mode.

---

## Error Handling
- The class includes basic checks for valid tool names and handles potential errors during operations.

---

## Notes
- The `SurgicalSimulator` class is designed to simulate surgical operations.
- It supports multiple surgical tools, each with different precision and damage values.
- The class provides methods for visualizing operations and training in a surgical simulator.
- The `visualize_operation` and `visualize_training_mode` methods use Pygame to provide an interactive visualization of the surgical process.
