# SurgicalSimulator Class

---

## Overview
The `SurgicalSimulator` class simulates surgical operations on biological entities such as cells, tissues, organs, and systems. It supports various operations with configurable precision, robot assistance, and emergency modes. The class logs operations and calculates risk scores for each operation.

---

## Class Definition

```python
class SurgicalSimulator:
    OPERATION_DIFFICULTIES = {
        "repair": 0.1,
        "remove_organelle": 0.3,
        "remove_cells": 0.4,
        "stimulate_growth": 0.2,
        "transplant": 0.5,
        "repair_tissue": 0.3,
        "reduce_stress": 0.2,
        "boost_immunity": 0.3,
    }

    def __init__(self, precision: float = 0.9, robot_assisted: bool = False):
        """
        Initialize a new SurgicalSimulator object.
        :param precision: Base precision of surgical operations (0.0 to 1.0).
        :param robot_assisted: Whether the simulator is robot-assisted.
        """
        ...
```

## Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `precision` | `float` | Base precision of surgical operations. |
| `robot_assisted` | `bool` | Whether the simulator is robot-assisted. |
| `operation_history` | `List[Dict]` | History of performed operations. |

## Data Classes

### OperationResult
```python
@dataclass
class OperationResult:
    success: bool
    message: str
    risk_score: float
    details: Optional[Dict] = None
```
- Represents the result of a surgical operation, including success status, message, risk score, and optional details.

---

## Custom Exceptions

### SurgicalError
```python
class SurgicalError(Exception):
    """Base class for all surgical simulation errors."""
    ...
```
- Base class for surgical simulation errors.

### InvalidTargetError
```python
class InvalidTargetError(SurgicalError):
    """Raised when the target of a surgical operation is not valid."""
    ...
```
- Raised when the target of a surgical operation is invalid.

### OperationFailedError
```python
class OperationFailedError(SurgicalError):
    """Raised when a surgical operation fails critically."""
    ...
```
- Raised when a surgical operation fails critically.

---

## Methods

### Initialization and Configuration
- **`__init__(self, precision: float = 0.9, robot_assisted: bool = False)`**
  Initializes a new `SurgicalSimulator` instance with the specified precision and robot assistance.

- **`change_precision(self, new_precision: float)`**
  Changes the precision of the simulator.

- **`toggle_robot_assistance(self)`**
  Toggles robot assistance, adjusting precision accordingly.

- **`toggle_emergency_mode(self)`**
  Toggles emergency mode, adjusting precision accordingly.

---

### Operation Execution
- **`operate(self, target: Union[Cell, Tissue, Organ, System, List[Union[Cell, Tissue, Organ, System]]], operation: str, **kwargs) -> Union[OperationResult, List[OperationResult]]`**
  Executes a surgical operation on the specified target(s).

- **`_operate_single(self, target: Union[Cell, Tissue, Organ, System], operation: str, **kwargs) -> OperationResult`**
  Executes a surgical operation on a single target.

---

### Target Validation
- **`_is_valid_target(self, target) -> bool`**
  Validates if the target is a valid type for surgical operations.

---

### Precision Calculation
- **`_calculate_effective_precision(self, difficulty: float) -> float`**
  Calculates the effective precision for an operation based on its difficulty, robot assistance, and emergency mode.

---

### Operation Logging
- **`_log_operation(self, result: OperationResult, target: Union[Cell, Tissue, Organ, System], operation: str)`**
  Logs the result of an operation.

---

### Target-Specific Operations
- **`_operate_on_cell(self, cell: Cell, operation: str, precision: float, **kwargs) -> OperationResult`**
  Executes a surgical operation on a cell.

- **`_operate_on_tissue(self, tissue: Tissue, operation: str, precision: float, **kwargs) -> OperationResult`**
  Executes a surgical operation on a tissue.

- **`_operate_on_organ(self, organ: Organ, operation: str, precision: float, **kwargs) -> OperationResult`**
  Executes a surgical operation on an organ.

- **`_operate_on_system(self, system: System, operation: str, precision: float, **kwargs) -> OperationResult`**
  Executes a surgical operation on a system.

---

### Serialization and Deserialization
- **`to_json(self) -> str`**
  Converts the simulator's state to a JSON string.

- **`from_json(cls, json_data: str) -> 'SurgicalSimulator'`**
  Creates a `SurgicalSimulator` instance from a JSON string.

---

### String Representation
- **`__str__(self) -> str`**
  Returns a string representation of the simulator.

---

## Example Usage

```python
# Initialize the surgical simulator
simulator = SurgicalSimulator(precision=0.95, robot_assisted=True)

# Create a cell
cell = Cell(name="Cell1", cell_type="epithelial")

# Perform a repair operation on the cell
result = simulator.operate(cell, "repair", repair_amount=15)
print(result)

# Create a tissue
tissue = Tissue(name="Tissue1", tissue_type="epithelial")

# Perform a remove_cells operation on the tissue
result = simulator.operate(tissue, "remove_cells", num_cells=2)
print(result)

# Toggle emergency mode
simulator.toggle_emergency_mode()

# Change precision
simulator.change_precision(0.98)

# Serialize the simulator to JSON
simulator_json = simulator.to_json()
print(simulator_json)

# Deserialize the simulator from JSON
new_simulator = SurgicalSimulator.from_json(simulator_json)
print(new_simulator)
```

---

## Expected Output

```
OperationResult(success=True, message='Successfully repaired cell. Health increased by 15.', risk_score=0.1, details=None)
OperationResult(success=True, message='Successfully removed 2 cells from tissue.', risk_score=0.4, details=None)
SurgicalSimulator(precision=0.98, robot_assisted=True, emergency_mode=True, operations_performed=2)
{"precision": 0.98, "robot_assisted": true, "emergency_mode": true, "operation_history": [...]}
SurgicalSimulator(precision=0.98, robot_assisted=True, emergency_mode=True, operations_performed=2)
```

---

## Dependencies
- **`dataclasses`**: For defining the `OperationResult` data class.
- **`json`**: For serialization and deserialization.
- **`typing`**: For type hints.
- **`random`**: For simulating random outcomes of operations.
- **`Cell`, `Tissue`, `Organ`, `System`**: Classes representing biological entities.

---

## Error Handling
- **`InvalidTargetError`**: Raised when the target of a surgical operation is not valid.
- **`OperationFailedError`**: Raised when a surgical operation fails critically.

---

## Notes
- The `SurgicalSimulator` class is designed to simulate surgical operations on various biological entities.
- The precision of operations can be adjusted based on robot assistance and emergency mode.
- The class logs all operations and calculates risk scores for each operation.
- Serialization and deserialization methods (`to_json`, `from_json`) allow for easy storage and retrieval of the simulator's state.
