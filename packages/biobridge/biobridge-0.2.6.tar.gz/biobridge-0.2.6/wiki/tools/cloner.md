# Cloner Class

---

## Overview
The `Cloner` class provides static methods for cloning biological entities such as DNA, cells, tissues, and systems. It supports concurrent cloning operations to efficiently grow tissues and systems from individual cells.

---

## Class Definition

```python
class Cloner:
    @staticmethod
    def clone_dna(dna: DNA, degradation_rate=0.01) -> DNA:
        """
        Clone DNA with potential degradation.
        :param dna: The DNA to be cloned.
        :param degradation_rate: The probability of degradation at each nucleotide.
        :return: A new DNA object that is a clone of the input DNA with potential degradation.
        """
        ...
```

## Methods

### DNA Cloning
- **`clone_dna(dna: DNA, degradation_rate=0.01) -> DNA`**
  Clones a DNA object with potential degradation.

  - **Parameters**:
    - `dna`: The DNA object to be cloned.
    - `degradation_rate`: The probability of degradation at each nucleotide (default: 0.01).

  - **Returns**: A new DNA object that is a clone of the input DNA with potential degradation.

---

### Cell Cloning
- **`clone_cell(cell: Cell, degradation_rate=0.01) -> Cell`**
  Creates a clone of a given cell with potential DNA degradation.

  - **Parameters**:
    - `cell`: The cell to be cloned.
    - `degradation_rate`: The probability of degradation at each nucleotide (default: 0.01).

  - **Returns**: A new cell object that is a clone of the input cell.

  - **Details**:
    - Clones the cell's DNA, receptors, surface proteins, organelles, mitochondria, and internal proteins.
    - Maintains the cell's health, pH, osmolarity, and ion concentrations.

---

### Tissue Growth
- **`grow_tissue_from_cell(cell: Cell, num_cells=10, degradation_rate=0.01) -> Tissue`**
  Grows a tissue from a single cell by cloning the cell multiple times.

  - **Parameters**:
    - `cell`: The initial cell to start the tissue growth.
    - `num_cells`: The number of cells to grow in the tissue (default: 10).
    - `degradation_rate`: The probability of degradation at each nucleotide (default: 0.01).

  - **Returns**: A new tissue object grown from the initial cell.

  - **Details**:
    - Uses concurrent cloning to efficiently create multiple cells.
    - Sets default growth and healing rates for the tissue.

---

### System Growth
- **`grow_system_from_tissue(tissue: Tissue, num_tissues=5, degradation_rate=0.01) -> System`**
  Grows a system from a single tissue by cloning the tissue multiple times.

  - **Parameters**:
    - `tissue`: The initial tissue to start the system growth.
    - `num_tissues`: The number of tissues to grow in the system (default: 5).
    - `degradation_rate`: The probability of degradation at each nucleotide (default: 0.01).

  - **Returns**: A new system object grown from the initial tissue.

  - **Details**:
    - Uses concurrent cloning to efficiently create multiple tissues.
    - Sets default adaptation rate, stress level, health, and energy for the system.
    - Tracks the previous cell and tissue counts.

## Example Usage

```python
# Clone a DNA object
dna = DNA(sequence="ATGCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCG")
cloned_dna = Cloner.clone_dna(dna, degradation_rate=0.01)
print(f"Cloned DNA sequence: {cloned_dna.sequence}")

# Create a cell
cell = Cell(name="LiverCell", cell_type="Liver")
cell.dna = dna

# Clone the cell
cloned_cell = Cloner.clone_cell(cell, degradation_rate=0.01)
print(f"Cloned cell name: {cloned_cell.name}")

# Grow a tissue from the cell
tissue = Cloner.grow_tissue_from_cell(cell, num_cells=10, degradation_rate=0.01)
print(f"Tissue name: {tissue.name}, Number of cells: {len(tissue.cells)}")

# Grow a system from the tissue
system = Cloner.grow_system_from_tissue(tissue, num_tissues=5, degradation_rate=0.01)
print(f"System name: {system.name}, Number of tissues: {len(system.tissues)}")
```

---

## Dependencies
- **`concurrent.futures`**: For concurrent execution of cloning tasks.
- **`biobridge.blocks.cell.Cell`**: For cell objects.
- **`biobridge.blocks.tissue.Tissue`**: For tissue objects.
- **`biobridge.networks.system.System`**: For system objects.
- **`biobridge.genes.dna.DNA`**: For DNA objects.

---

## Error Handling
- The class does not explicitly handle errors, but it relies on the underlying methods of the DNA, cell, tissue, and system classes to handle their own errors.

---

## Notes
- The `Cloner` class is designed to efficiently clone biological entities using concurrent execution.
- It supports cloning DNA, cells, tissues, and systems, with potential degradation to simulate real-world conditions.
- The class uses a static method design, allowing for easy integration and usage without instantiation.
