class Query:
    """A general-purpose representation of a registry query.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dimensions : `DimensionGroup`
        The dimensions that span the query and are used to join its relations
        together.
    backend : `QueryBackend`
        Backend object used to create the query and new ones derived from it.
    context : `QueryContext`
        Context manager that holds relation engines and database connections
        for the query.
    relation : `Relation`
        The relation tree representation of the query as a series of operations
        on tables.
    governor_constraints : `~collections.abc.Mapping` [ `str`, \
            `~collections.abc.Set` [ `str` ] ]
        Constraints on governor dimensions encoded in this query's relation.
        This is a mapping from governor dimension name to sets of values that
        dimension may take.
    is_deferred : `bool`
        If `True`, modifier methods that return a related `Query` object should
        not immediately execute the new query.
    has_record_columns : `bool` or `DimensionElement`
        Whether this query's relation already includes columns for all or some
        dimension element records: `True` means all elements in ``dimensions``
        either have records present in ``record_caches`` or all columns present
        in ``relation``, while a specific `DimensionElement` means that element
        does.
    record_caches : `~collections.abc.Mapping` [ `str`, \
            `DimensionRecordSet` ], optional
        Cached dimension record values.

    Notes
    -----
    Iterating over a `Query` yields mappings from `ColumnTag` to the associated
    value for each row.  The `iter_data_ids`, `iter_dataset_refs`, and
    `iter_dimension_records` methods can be used to instead iterate over
    various butler primitives derived from these rows.

    Iterating over a `Query` may or may not execute database queries again each
    time, depending on the state of its relation tree - see `Query.run` for
    details.

    Query is immutable; all methods that might appear to modify it in place
    actually return a new object (though many attributes will be shared).

    Query is currently (still) an internal-to-Registry object, with only the
    "QueryResults" classes that are backed by it directly exposed to users.  It
    has been designed with the intent that it will eventually play a larger
    role, either as the main query result object in a redesigned query
    interface, or a "power user" result option that accompanies simpler
    replacements for the current "QueryResults" objects.

        executed : `Query`
            New query that holds the query results.

        Notes
        -----
        Iterating over the results of a query that has been `run` will always
        iterate over an existing container, while iterating over a query that
        has not been run will result in executing at least some of the query
        each time.

        Running a query also sets its `is_deferred` flag to `False`, which will
        cause new queries constructed by its methods to be run immediately,
        unless ``defer=True`` is passed to the factory method. After a query
        has been run, factory methods will also tend to prefer to apply new
        operations (e.g. `with_only_column`, `sliced`, `sorted`) via Python
        code acting on the existing container rather than going back to SQL,
        which can be less efficient overall that applying operations to a
        deferred query and executing them all only at the end.

        Running a query is represented in terms of relations by adding a
        `~lsst.daf.relation.Materialization` marker relation in the iteration
        engine and then processing the relation tree; this attaches the
        container of rows to that new relation to short-circuit any future
        processing of the tree and lock changes to the tree upstream of it.
        This is very different from the SQL-engine
        `~lsst.daf.relation.Materialization` added to the tree by the
        `materialize` method from a user perspective, though it has a similar
        representation in the relation tree.

        element table (if it has not already been included) on keys already

        ----------
        dataset_type : `DatasetType`
            Dataset type to search for.  May not be a component.
        collections : `~typing.Any`
            Collection search path or pattern.  Must be a single collection
            name or ordered sequence if ``find_first=True``.  See

        columns : `~collections.abc.Set` [ `str` ]
            Dataset columns to include in the new query.  Options include

            - ``dataset_id``: the unique identifier of the dataset.  The type
              is implementation-dependent.  Never nullable.  Included by
              default.
            - ``ingest_date``: the date and time the dataset was added to the
              data repository.
            - ``run``: the foreign key column to the `~CollectionType.RUN`
              collection holding the dataset (not necessarily the collection
              name).  The type is dependent on the collection manager
              implementation.  Included by default.
            - ``collection``: the foreign key column to the collection type in
              which the dataset was actually in this search.  The type is
              dependent on the collection manager implementation.  This may
              differ from ``run`` if the dataset is present in a matching
              `~CollectionType.TAGGED` or `~CollectionType.CALIBRATION`
              collection, which means the same dataset may also appear multiple
              times in the query results.
            - ``timespan``: the validity range for datasets found in a
              `~CollectionType.CALIBRATION` collection, or ``NULL`` for other
              collection types.

            The default columns (``dataset_id`` and ``run``) are sufficient to
            enable `iter_dataset_refs`, which also takes care of translating
            the internal ``RUN`` collection key into its public name.

            will return a query that is constrained by dataset existence in
            some matching collection that does not actually return which
            datasets existed.
        defer : `bool`, optional
            If `False`, run the new query immediately.  If `True`, do not.  If

        Parameters
        ----------
        exact : `bool`, optional

        discard : `bool`, optional
            If `True`, compute the exact count even if it would require running
            the full query and then throwing away the result rows after
            counting them.  If `False`, this is an error, as the user would

            duplicates, if there are any.
