Unlike the critic tool (which plays devil's advocate), this provides:
- Objective assessment of code quality
- Recognition of what's done well
- Constructive suggestions for improvement
- Focus on practical concerns
- No predetermined bias or harsh judgment

Parameters:
- focus: Review focus area (GENERAL, FUNCTIONALITY, READABILITY, MAINTAINABILITY, TESTING, DOCUMENTATION, ARCHITECTURE)
- work_description: Clear description of what you've implemented
- code_snippets: Optional code snippets to review (as a list of strings)
- file_paths: Optional list of file paths you've modified
- context: Optional additional context about the implementation

The review will be balanced, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement.

Example:
review(

    code_snippets=["func AddImport(file string, importPath string) error { ... }"],
    file_paths=["/path/to/import_handler.go"],
