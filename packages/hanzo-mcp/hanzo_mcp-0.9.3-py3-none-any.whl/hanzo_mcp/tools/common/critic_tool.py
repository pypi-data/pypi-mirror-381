This tool forces a critical thinking mode that reviews all code for errors, improvements, and edge cases.
It ensures tests are run, tests pass, and maintains high quality standards.

This is your inner critic that:
- Always questions assumptions
- Looks for potential bugs and edge cases
- Ensures proper error handling
- Verifies test coverage
- Checks for performance issues
- Reviews security implications
- Suggests improvements and refactoring
- Ensures code follows best practices
- Questions design decisions
- Looks for missing documentation

Common use cases:
1. Before finalizing any code changes - review for bugs, edge cases, and improvements
2. After implementing a feature - critically analyze if it truly solves the problem
3. When tests pass too easily - question if tests are comprehensive enough
4. Before marking a task complete - ensure all quality standards are met
5. When something seems too simple - look for hidden complexity or missing requirements
6. After fixing a bug - analyze if the fix addresses root cause or just symptoms

<critic_example>
Code Review Analysis:
- Implementation Issues:
  * No error handling for network failures in API calls
  * Missing validation for user input boundaries
  * Race condition possible in concurrent updates
  * Memory leak potential in event listener registration
  
- Test Coverage Gaps:
  * No tests for error scenarios
  * Missing edge case: empty array input
  * No performance benchmarks for large datasets
  * Integration tests don't cover authentication failures
  
- Security Concerns:
  * SQL injection vulnerability in query construction
  * Missing rate limiting on public endpoints
  * Sensitive data logged in debug mode
  
- Performance Issues:
  * O(nÂ²) algorithm where O(n log n) is possible
  * Database queries in a loop (N+1 problem)
  * No caching for expensive computations
  
- Code Quality:
  * Functions too long and doing multiple things
  * Inconsistent naming conventions
  * Missing type annotations
  * No documentation for complex algorithms
  
- Design Flaws:
  * Tight coupling between modules
  * Hard-coded configuration values
  * No abstraction for external dependencies
  * Violates single responsibility principle

Recommendations:
1. Add comprehensive error handling with retry logic
2. Implement input validation with clear error messages
3. Use database transactions to prevent race conditions
4. Add memory cleanup in component unmount
5. Parameterize SQL queries to prevent injection
6. Implement rate limiting middleware
7. Use environment variables for sensitive config
8. Refactor algorithm to use sorting approach
9. Batch database queries
10. Add memoization for expensive calculations
