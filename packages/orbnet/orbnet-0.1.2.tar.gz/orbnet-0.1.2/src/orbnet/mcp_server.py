Orb Network MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server that provides access to Orb network quality datasets.
Uses the orbnet package to retrieve data from Orb sensors.

Stateful Polling:
    This server uses a fixed caller_id for the lifetime of the server process.
    This means:
    - First query returns all available historical data
    - Subsequent queries in the same session return only new data
    - Server restart generates a new caller_id and starts fresh

    You can override the default caller_id in any tool call if you need different
    polling behavior.

    This server provides real-time network quality monitoring from Orb sensors.
    
    **What You Can Ask:**
    ✓ "What's my current network quality?"
    ✓ "Why is my internet slow right now?"
    ✓ "Show me speed test history from today"
    ✓ "Is my connection good enough for video calls?"
    ✓ "Compare my network quality from yesterday vs today"
    ✓ "Summarize network quality across all of my orbs"
    
    **Primary Metrics:**
    • Orb Score (0-100): Overall network health
    • Responsiveness: Latency, jitter, packet loss
    • Speed: Download/upload bandwidth
    • Web Performance: Page load times, DNS speed
    
    **Data Availability:**
    - 1-second granularity for recent detailed analysis
    - 1-minute aggregates for trends
    - Historical data depends on sensor configuration
    
    **Key Tools:**
    • get_scores_1m() - Quick health check
    • get_all_datasets() - Complete snapshot
    • get_responsiveness() - Good for realtime applications
    
    **Built-in Workflows:**
    Use prompts like 'analyze_network_quality' or 'troubleshoot_slow_internet'
    for guided analysis.

    **Troubleshooting:**
    If an Orb sensor cannot be reached, check the following:
    - Is the Orb sensor currently running?
    - Has [Local API](https://orb.net/docs/deploy-and-configure/datasets-configuration#local-api) access been enabled for that Orb?
    - Has the user given the right IP address and port?

    **Note:**
    A given Orb sensor is not necessarily on the same network as
    the user, so the results may not be representative of the network
    quality that the user is experiencing. Be sure to attribute the
    results to the Orb, not the user.

    Retrieve 1-minute granularity Scores dataset from an Orb sensor.

    The Scores Dataset includes Orb Score and its component scores (Responsiveness,
    Reliability, and Speed), along with underlying network quality measures.

    The Orb score represents the overall health of your network using
    measurements of responsiveness, reliability, and speed.

        - Responsiveness: How quickly and consistently a network responds
                          to requests
        - Reliability: How consistent and dependable the network is
        - Speed: How fast a network can transfer data to and from
                 a device

    A higher Orb Score indicates better overall performance.
    Scores can be interpreted as follows:

        - 90-100: Excellent performance and quality
        - 80-89: Good performance with room for improvement
        - 70-79: Ok performance with room for improvement
        - 50-59: Fair performance with noticeable issues
        - 0-49: Poor performance that needs attention


    Note on Stateful Polling:
        By default, this tool uses a session-specific caller_id. This means your
        first call returns all available data, and subsequent calls return only
        new data collected since the last call. This makes it efficient to check
        for updates without receiving duplicate records.

    Args:
        host: Orb sensor hostname or IP (default: from ORB_HOST env var or 'localhost')
        port: API port number (default: from ORB_PORT env var or 7080)
        caller_id: Unique ID to track polling state. Leave as None to use the default
                   session-specific ID, or provide your own for custom polling behavior.
        timeout: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30.0)

    Returns:
        List of score records, each containing:
        - orb_score: Overall network quality score (0-100)
        - responsiveness_score: Network responsiveness score (0-100)

        - speed_score: Network speed score (0-100)
