# orbnet

`orbnet` provides a simple, async Python interface to the [Orb Local API](https://orb.net/docs/deploy-and-configure/datasets-configuration#local-api) and [Datasets](https://orb.net/docs/deploy-and-configure/datasets), allowing you to easily retrieve comprehensive network quality metrics from your Orb sensors.

## What is Orb?

[Orb](https://orb.net) is an intelligent network monitoring platform that continuously measures internet experience.
Unlike traditional speed tests that provide only momentary snapshots, Orb gives you real-time insights into your network's responsiveness, reliability, and speed.

## orbnet Features

- **Async/await support** - Built on `httpx` for efficient concurrent requests
- **Type safety** - Pydantic models for data validation
- **Multiple granularities** - 1-second, 15-second, and 1-minute data buckets
- **Polling support** - Automatically fetch only new records
- **Flexible formats** - JSON or JSONL output
- **Comprehensive datasets** - Scores, responsiveness, web performance, and speed tests

## Installation

```bash
pip install orbnet
```

Or using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv add orbnet
```

### Prerequisites

- [Install Orb](https://orb.net/get-orb/) on your machine of choice
- Enable [Local API](https://orb.net/docs/deploy-and-configure/datasets-configuration#local-api) access


## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from orbnet import OrbAPIClient

async def main():
    # Connect to your Orb sensor
    client = OrbAPIClient(host="192.168.0.20", port=7080)
    
    # Get the latest network quality scores
    scores = await client.get_scores_1m()
    
    if scores:
        latest = scores[-1]
        print(f"Orb Score: {latest['orb_score']:.0f}")
        print(f"Responsiveness: {latest['responsiveness_score']:.0f}")
        print(f"Reliability: {latest['reliability_score']:.0f}")
        print(f"Speed: {latest['speed_score']:.0f}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

```
Orb Score: 93
Responsiveness: 91
Reliability: 100
Speed: 95
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Data Retrieval

```python
from orbnet import OrbAPIClient

client = OrbAPIClient(host="192.168.0.20")

# Get 1-minute scores
scores = await client.get_scores_1m()

# Get responsiveness data (1s, 15s, or 1m granularity)
responsiveness = await client.get_responsiveness(granularity="1s")

# Get web responsiveness (TTFB and DNS)
web_data = await client.get_web_responsiveness()

# Get speed test results
speeds = await client.get_speed_results()

# Get all datasets at once
all_data = await client.get_all_datasets()
```

### Real-Time Monitoring

Monitor your network continuously with automatic polling:

```python
async def monitor_network():
    client = OrbAPIClient(host="192.168.0.20")
    
    # Poll for new data every 10 seconds
    async for records in client.poll_dataset(
        dataset_name="responsiveness_1s",
        interval=10.0
    ):
        if records:
            latest = records[-1]
            latency_ms = latest['latency_avg_us'] / 1000
            print(f"Latency: {latency_ms:.1f}ms")
```

### Alert on Network Issues

```python
def alert_callback(dataset_name, records):
    for record in records:
        # Alert on high latency
        if record['latency_avg_us'] > 50000:  # 50ms
            print(f"⚠️  High latency: {record['latency_avg_us']}μs")
        
        # Alert on packet loss
        if record['packet_loss_pct'] > 1.0:  # 1%
            print(f"⚠️  Packet loss: {record['packet_loss_pct']:.2f}%")

async def monitor_with_alerts():
    client = OrbAPIClient(host="192.168.0.20")
    
    async for _ in client.poll_dataset(
        dataset_name="responsiveness_1s",
        interval=5.0,
        callback=alert_callback
    ):
        pass  # Callback handles alerts
```

### Analyze Speed Trends

```python
async def analyze_speeds():
    client = OrbAPIClient(host="192.168.0.20")
    speeds = await client.get_speed_results()
    
    # Convert to Mbps and calculate statistics
    downloads = [s['download_kbps'] / 1000 for s in speeds]
    
    avg_speed = sum(downloads) / len(downloads)
    min_speed = min(downloads)
    max_speed = max(downloads)
    
    print(f"Download Speed Stats:")
    print(f"  Average: {avg_speed:.1f} Mbps")
    print(f"  Minimum: {min_speed:.1f} Mbps")
    print(f"  Maximum: {max_speed:.1f} Mbps")
    
    # Check SLA compliance
    required_mbps = 100
    below_sla = [s for s in downloads if s < required_mbps]
    
    if below_sla:
        pct_below = (len(below_sla) / len(downloads)) * 100
        print(f"⚠️  {pct_below:.1f}% of tests below {required_mbps} Mbps")
```

### Compare Network Performance by ISP

```python
async def compare_by_isp():
    client = OrbAPIClient(host="192.168.0.20")
    scores = await client.get_scores_1m()
    
    # Group scores by ISP
    isp_scores = {}
    for record in scores:
        isp = record['isp_name']
        if isp not in isp_scores:
            isp_scores[isp] = []
        isp_scores[isp].append(record['orb_score'])
    
    # Calculate averages
    for isp, scores_list in isp_scores.items():
        avg = sum(scores_list) / len(scores_list)
        print(f"{isp}: {avg:.1f}/100")
```

Detailed responsiveness metrics at 1-second, 15-second, or 1-minute granularity:

- `lag_avg_us` - Average lag in microseconds

- `jitter_avg_us` - Jitter (latency variation) in microseconds
- `packet_loss_pct` - Packet loss percentage
- Router-specific metrics for local network analysis

### Web Responsiveness (`web_responsiveness_results`)

Web browsing experience metrics (once per minute):

- `ttfb_us` - Time to First Byte in microseconds
- `dns_us` - DNS resolution time in microseconds
- `web_url` - URL being tested

### Speed (`speed_results`)

Speed test results (once per hour by default):

## Configuration

### Client Options

```python
client = OrbAPIClient(
    host="192.168.0.20",           # Orb sensor IP/hostname
    port=7080,                      # API port (default: 7080)
    caller_id="my-app",             # Persistent ID for polling
    client_id="MyApp/1.0.0",        # User-Agent identifier
    timeout=30.0,                   # Request timeout in seconds
)
```

### Caller ID

The `caller_id` parameter enables stateful polling - the Orb sensor tracks which records each caller has already received, returning only new data on subsequent requests. This is perfect for building real-time monitoring systems.

```python
# First request returns all available data
client = OrbAPIClient(host="192.168.0.20", caller_id="monitor-1")
data1 = await client.get_scores_1m()  # Returns: 100 records

# Second request returns only new data
data2 = await client.get_scores_1m()  # Returns: 5 new records
```

### Client ID

The `client_id` is sent as the User-Agent header and helps identify your application in Orb sensor logs:

```python
# Development
client = OrbAPIClient(
    host="192.168.0.20",
    client_id="MyApp/dev-0.1.0"
)

# Production with metadata
client = OrbAPIClient(
    host="192.168.0.20",
    client_id="MyApp/1.0.0 (production; host=server-01)"
)
```
