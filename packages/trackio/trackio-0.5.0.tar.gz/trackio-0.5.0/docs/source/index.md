`trackio` is a lightweight, free experiment tracking Python library built on top of Hugging Face Datasets and Spaces ðŸ¤—.

- **API compatible** with `wandb.init`, `wandb.log`, and `wandb.finish`. Drop-in replacement: just

  ```python
  import trackio as wandb
  ```

- **Local-first** design: dashboard runs locally by default. You can also host it on Spaces by specifying a `space_id`.
- Persists logs locally (or in a private Hugging Face Dataset)
- Visualize experiments with a Gradio dashboard locally (or on Hugging Face Spaces)
- Everything here, including hosting on Hugging Face, is **free**!

Trackio is designed to be lightweight (the core codebase is <3,000 lines of Python code), not fully-featured. It is designed in an extensible way and written entirely in Python so that developers can easily fork the repository and add functionality that they care about.
