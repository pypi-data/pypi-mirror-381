# FraNC - Framework for Noise Cancellation in gravitational wave detection

![Test status](https://github.com/NewtonianNoise/franc/actions/workflows/testing.yml/badge.svg)
![Linting status](https://github.com/NewtonianNoise/franc/actions/workflows/pylint.yml/badge.svg)
![Static type check status](https://github.com/NewtonianNoise/franc/actions/workflows/mypy.yml/badge.svg)

A framework to develop and evaluate noise cancellation techniques.
Includes python implementations of different static and adaptive filtering techniques.
The techniques for the prediction of a correlated signal component from witness signals provide a unified interface.
