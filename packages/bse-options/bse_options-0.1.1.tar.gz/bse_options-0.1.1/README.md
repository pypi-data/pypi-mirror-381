# BSE Option Chain Scraper

This repository provides an **Unofficial Python API** to fetch **Option Chain Data** from the [BSE India](https://www.bseindia.com) website.

The scraper uses `requests` and `mthrottle` with proper headers and endpoints exposed by BSEâ€™s API to return option chain data in a structured JSON format, similar to NSEâ€™s option chain format.
