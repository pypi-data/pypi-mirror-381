"""Flow API models package (backwards-compatible facade).

This package provides a stable import surface compatible with
``from flow.sdk.models import ...``. During the PR-1.1 refactor, models
are being split into submodules. We re-export lightweight symbols
and lazily load the remaining symbols from a legacy module to keep
cold imports fast.

Additionally, this module re-exports IR (Intermediate Representation) models
as the canonical platform contract.
