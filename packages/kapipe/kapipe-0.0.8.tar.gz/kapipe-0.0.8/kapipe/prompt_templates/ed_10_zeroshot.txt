### Task

You are given a piece of text and a list of **entity mentions** that appear in it.  
For each entity mention, you are also given a list of **candidate concepts** from the {knowledge_base_name_prompt} knowledge base.

Your task is to:

1. **Disambiguate each entity mention** by selecting the most appropriate Concept ID from the provided candidates, based on the **context of the text**.
2. If none of the candidates are appropriate, assign "NA" to that mention.

### Guidelines

- Use the **full document context** to make your decision â€” not just the mention in isolation.
- Choose **only one** Concept ID for each mention.
- If **none of the candidates** fits the meaning of the mention in context, assign "NA".
- Do **not modify** the mention text. Use the exact form as given.

### Output Format

For each entity mention, output a line in this format:

- Mention Text | Concept ID

Use bullet points (`-`) for each line. Example:

- Aspirin | C0004057  
- Stage II breast cancer | C0278488  
- light therapy | NA

### Test Case

Now, assign the most appropriate Concept ID to each entity mention in the following text, using the context of the document.

{test_case_prompt}

Provide the output in the bullet-point format specified above.
