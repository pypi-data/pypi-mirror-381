## ü§ñ What is KAPipe?

**KAPipe** is a modular pipeline for comprehensive **knowledge acquisition** from unstructured documents.  
It supports **extraction**, **organization**, **retrieval**, and **utilization** of knowledge, serving as a core framework for building intelligent systems that reason over structured knowledge.  

Currently, KAPipe provides the following functionalities:

- üß©**Triple Extraction**  
    - Extract facts in the form of (head entity, relation, tail entity) triples from raw text.

- üï∏Ô∏è**Knowledge Graph Construction**  
    - Build a symbolic knowledge graph from triples, optionally augmented with external ontologies or knowledge bases (e.g., Wikidata, UMLS).

- üß±**Community Clustering**  
    - Cluster the knowledge graph into semantically coherent subgraphs (*communities*).

- üìù**Report Generation**  
    - Generate textual reports (or summaries) of graph communities.

- ‚úÇÔ∏è**Chunking**  
    - Split text (e.g., community report) into fixed-size chunks based on a predefined token length (e.g., n=300).

- üîç**Passage Retrieval**  
    - Retrieve relevant chunks for given queries using lexical or dense retrieval.

- üí¨**Question Answering**  
    - Answer questions using retrieved chunks as context.

These components together form an implementation of **graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG)**, enabling question answering and reasoning grounded in structured knowledge.

## üì¶ Installation

### Step 1: Set up a Python environment
```bash
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
```

### Step 2: Install KAPipe
```bash
pip install kapipe
```

### Step 3: Download pretrained models and configurations

Pretrained models and configuration files can be downloaded from the following Google Drive folder:

üìÅ [KAPipe Release Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16ypMCoLYf5kDxglDD_NYoCNAfhTy4Qwp)

Download the latest release file named release.YYYYMMDD.tar.gz, then extract it to the ~/.kapipe directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kapipe
mv release.YYYYMMDD.tar.gz ~/.kapipe
cd ~/.kapipe
tar -zxvf release.YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
```

If the extraction is successful, you should see a directory `~/.kapipe/download/`, which contains model resources.

## üß© Triple Extraction

### Overview

The **Triple Extraction** module identifies relational facts from raw text in the form of (head entity, relation, tail entity) **triples**.

Specifically, this is achieved through the following cascade of subtasks:

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
    - Detect entity mentions (spans) and classify their types.
1. **Entity Disambiguation Retrieval (ED-Retrieval)**:
    - Retrieve candidate concept IDs from a knowledge base for each mention.
1. **Entity Disambiguation Reranking (ED-Reranking)**:
    - Select the most probable concept ID from the retrieved candidates.
1. **Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE)**:
    - Extract relational triples based on the disambiguated entity set.

### How to Use

```python
from kapipe.pipelines import TripleExtractionPipeline

# Load the triple extraction pipeline
# Example 1
# (1) NER: GPT-4o-mini (with prompt and user-defined entity types)
# (2) ED-Retrieval: Dummy Retriever (assigning the lowercased mention string as the entity ID)
# (3) ED-Reranking: None
# (4) DocRE: GPT-4o-mini (with prompt and user-defined relation labels)
pipe = TripleExtractionPipeline(
    module_kwargs={
        "ner": {
            "identifier": "gpt4omini_any",
            "user_defined_entity_types": [{"entity_type": "(your favorite type)", "definition": "..."}]
        },
        "ed_retrieval": {"identifier": "dummy_entity_retriever"},
        "ed_reranking": {"identifier": "identical_entity_reranker"},
        "docre": {
            "identifier": "gpt4omini_any",
            "user_defined_relation_labels": [{"relation_label": "(your favorite label)", "definition": "..."}]
        }
    }
)
# Example 2
# (1) NER: Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (with prompt for CDR, i.e., {Chemical, Disease} entity types)
# (2) ED-Retrieval: BLINK Bi-Encoder (trained on CDR+MeSH)
# (3) ED-Reranking: Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (with prompt for CDR+MeSH)
# (4) DocRE: Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (with prompt for CDR, i.e., Chemical-Induce-Disease relation label)
pipe = TripleExtractionPipeline(
    module_kwargs={
        "ner": {"identifier": "qwen2_5_7b_cdr", "gpu": 1},
        "ed_retrieval": {"identifier": "blink_bi_encoder_cdr", "gpu": 2},
        "ed_reranking": {"identifier": "qwen2_5_7b_cdr", "gpu": 1},
        "docre": {"identifier": "qwen2_5_7b_cdr", "gpu": 1}
    },
    share_backborn_llm=True
)
# Example 3
# (1) NER: Biaffine-NER (trained on CDR, i.e., {Chemical, Disease} entity types)
# (2) ED-Retrieval: BLINK Bi-Encoder (trained on CDR+MeSH)
# (3) ED-Reranking: BLINK Cross-Encoder (trained on CDR+MeSH)
# (4) DocRE: ATLOP (trained on CDR, i.e., Chemical-Induce-Disease relation label)
pipe = TripleExtractionPipeline(
    module_kwargs={
        "ner": {"identifier": "biaffine_ner_cdr", "gpu": 1},
        "ed_retrieval": {"identifier": "blink_bi_encoder_cdr", "gpu": 1},
        "ed_reranking": {"identifier": "blink_cross_encoder_cdr", "gpu": 2},
        "docre": {"identifier": "atlop_cdr", "gpu": 3}
    }
)

# Apply the triple extractor to your input document
document = pipe.extract(document)
```
(See `experiments/codes/run_triple_extraction_pipeline.py` for specific examples.)


### Input

This module takes as input:

1. ***Document***, or a dictionary containing
    - `doc_key` (str): Unique identifier for the document
    - `sentences` (list[str]): List of sentence strings (tokenized)

```json
{
    "doc_key": "6794356",
    "sentences": [
        "Tricuspid valve regurgitation and lithium carbonate toxicity in a newborn infant .",
        "A newborn with massive tricuspid regurgitation , atrial flutter , congestive heart failure , and a high serum lithium level is described .",
        ...
    ]
}
```
(See `experiments/data/examples/documents.json` for more details.)

Each subtask takes a ***Document*** object as input, augments it with new fields, and returns it.  
This allows custom metadata to persist throughout the triple extractor.

### Output

The output is also the same-format dictionary (***Document***), augmented with extracted entities and triples information:

- `doc_key` (str): Same as input
- `sentences` (list[str]): Same as input

            "entity_type": "Disease",
            "entity_id": "D014262"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "entities": [
        {
            "mention_indices": [0, 3, 7],
            "entity_type": "Disease",
            "entity_id": "D014262"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "relations": [
        {
            "arg1": 1,
            "relation": "CID",
            "arg2": 7
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## üï∏Ô∏è Knowledge Graph Construction

### Overview

The **Knowledge Graph Construction** module builds a **directed multi-relational graph** from a set of extracted triples.

- **Nodes** represent unique entities (i.e., concepts).
- **Edges** represent semantic relations between entities.

### How to Use

```python
from kapipe.graph_construction import GraphConstructor

PATH_TO_DOCUMENTS = "./experiments/data/examples/documents.json"
PATH_TO_TRIPLES = "./experiments/data/examples/additional_triples.json" # Or set to None
PATH_TO_ENTITY_DICT = "./experiments/data/examples/entity_dict.json" # Or set to None

# Initialize the knowledge graph constructor
constructor = GraphConstructor()

# Construct the knowledge graph
# Example 1 (use entity dictionary for enriching the node information)
graph = constructor.construct_knowledge_graph(
    path_documents_list=[PATH_TO_DOCUMENTS],
    path_additional_triples=PATH_TO_TRIPLES, # Optional
    path_entity_dict=PATH_TO_ENTITY_DICT
)
# Example 2 (without entity dictionary)
graph = constructor.construct_knowledge_graph(
    path_documents_list=[PATH_TO_DOCUMENTS],
    path_additional_triples=PATH_TO_TRIPLES, # Optional
    path_entity_dict=None
)
```
(See `experiments/codes/run_graph_construction.py` for specific examples.)

### Input

    },
    {
        "entity_id": "D000641",
        "entity_index": 610,
        "entity_type": "Chemical",

- `relation` (str): Type of semantic relation
- `doc_key_list` (list[str]): List of document IDs supporting this relation

(See `experiments/data/examples/graph.graphml` for more details.)

## üß± Community Clustering

### Overview

The **Community Clustering** module partitions the knowledge graph into **semantically coherent subgraphs**, referred to as *communities*.  
Each community represents a localized set of closely related concepts and relations, and serves as a fundamental unit of structured knowledge.

### How to Use

```python
from kapipe.community_clustering import (
    HierarchicalLeiden,
    NeighborhoodAggregation,
    TripleLevelFactorization
)

# Initialize the community clusterer
# Example 1 (Hierarchical Leiden)
clusterer = HierarchicalLeiden()
# Example 2 (Neighborhood Aggregation)
clusterer = NeighborhoodAggregation()
# Example 3 (Triple-Level Factorization)
clusterer = TripleLevelFactorization()

# Apply the community clusterer to the graph
communities = clusterer.cluster_communities(graph)
```
(See `experiments/codes/run_community_clustering.py` for specific examples.)

### Input

This module takes as input:

1. Knowledge graph (`networkx.MultiDiGraph`) produced by the **Knowledge Graph Construction** module.

### Output

The output is a list of hierarchical community records (dictionaries), each containing:

- `community_id` (str): Unique ID for the community
- `nodes` (list[str]): List of entity IDs belonging to the community (null for ROOT)
- `level` (int): Depth in the hierarchy (ROOT=-1)
- `parent_community_id` (str): ID of the parent community (null for ROOT)
- `child_community_ids` (list[str]): List of child community IDs (empty for leaf communities)

```json
[
    {
        "community_id": "ROOT",
        "nodes": null,
        "level": -1,
        "parent_community_id": null,
        "child_community_ids": [
            "0",
            "1",
            "2",
            "3",
            "4",
            "5",
            "6",
            "7",
            "8",
            "9"
        ]
    },
    {
        "community_id": "0",
        "nodes": [
            "D016651",
            "D014262",
            "D003866",
            "D003490",
            "D001145"
        ],
        "level": 0,
        "parent_community_id": "ROOT",
        "child_community_ids": [...]
    },
    ...
]
```
(See `experiments/data/examples/communities.json` for more details.)

This hierarchical structure enables multi-level organization of knowledge, particularly useful for coarse-to-fine report generation and scalable retrieval.

### Supported Methods

- **Hierarchical Leiden**
    - Recursively applies the Leiden algorithm (Traag et al., 2019) to optimize modularity. Large communities are subdivided until they satisfy a predefined size constraint (default: 10 nodes).
- **Neighborhood Aggregation**
    - Groups each node with its immediate neighbors to form local communities.
- **Triple-level Factorization**
    - Treats each individual (subject, relation, object) triple as an atomic community.

## üìù Report Generation

### Overview

The **Report Generation** module converts each community into a **natural language report**, making structured knowledge interpretable for both humans and language models.  

### How to Use

```python
from kapipe.report_generation import (
    LLMBasedReportGenerator,
    TemplateBasedReportGenerator
)

PATH_TO_REPORTS = "./experiments/data/examples/reports.jsonl"

# Initialize the report generator
# Example 1 (LLM-based; GPT-4o-mini)
generator = LLMBasedReportGenerator(
    llm_backend="openai",
    llm_kwargs={
        "openai_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "max_new_tokens": 2048,
    }
)
# Example 2 (LLM-based; Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct)
generator = LLMBasedReportGenerator(
    llm_backend="huggingface",
    llm_kwargs={
        "llm_name_or_path": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct",
        "max_new_tokens": 2048,
        "quantization_bits": -1,
    }
)
# Example 3 (Template-based)
generator = TemplateBasedReportGenerator()
 
# Generate community reports
generator.generate_community_reports(
    graph=graph,
    communities=communities,
    path_output=PATH_TO_REPORTS
)
```
(See `experiments/codes/run_report_generation.py` for specific examples.)

### Input

This module takes as input:

1. Knowledge graph (`networkx.MultiDiGraph`) generated by the **Knowledge Graph Construction** module.
1. List of community records generated by the **Community Clustering** module.

### Output

The output is a `.jsonl` file, where each line corresponds to one ***Passage***, a dictionary containing:

- `title` (str): Concice topic summary of the community
- `text` (str): Full natural language description of the community's content

```json
{"title": "Lithium Carbonate and Related Health Conditions", "text": "This report examines the interconnections between Lithium Carbonate, ...."}
{"title": "Phenobarbital and Drug-Induced Dyskinesia", "text": "This report examines the relationship between Phenobarbital, ..."}
{"title": "Ammonia and Valproic Acid in Disorders of Excessive Somnolence", "text": "This report examines the relationship between ammonia and valproic acid, ..."}
...
```
(See `experiments/data/examples/reports.jsonl` for more details.)

‚úÖ The output format is fully compatible with the **Chunking** module, which accepts any dictionary containing a `title` and `text` field.  
Thus, each community report can also be treated as a generic ***Passage***.

### Supported Methods

- **LLM-based Generation**
    - Uses a large language model (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) prompted with a community content to generate fluent summaries.
- **Template-based Generation**
    - Uses a deterministic format that verbalizes each entity/triple and linearizes them:
        - Entity format: `"{name} | {type} | {definition}"`
        - Triple format: `"{subject} | {relation} | {object}"`

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Chunking

### Overview

The **Chunking** module splits each input text into multiple **non-overlapping text chunks**, each constrained by a maximum token length (e.g., 100 tokens).  
This module is essential for preparing context units that are compatible with downstream modules such as retrieval and question answering.  

<!-- It supports any input that conforms to the following format:

- A dictionary containing a `"title"` and `"text"` field.  

This makes the module applicable not only to **community reports**, but also to other types of *Passage* data with similar structure. -->

### How to Use

```python
from kapipe.chunking import Chunker

MODEL_NAME = "en_core_web_sm"  # SpaCy tokenizer
WINDOW_SIZE = 100  # Max number of tokens per chunk

# Initialize the chunker
chunker = Chunker(model_name=MODEL_NAME)

# Chunk the passage
chunked_passages = chunker.split_passage_to_chunked_passages(
    passage=passage,
    window_size=WINDOW_SIZE
)
```
(See `experiments/codes/run_chunking.py` for specific examples.)

### Input

This module takes as input:

1. ***Passage***, or a dictionary containing `title` and `text` field.

    - `title` (str): Title of the passage
    - `text` (str): Full natural language description of the passage

```json
{
    "title": "Lithium Carbonate and Related Health Conditions",
    "text": "This report examines the interconnections between Lithium Carbonate, ..."
}
```

### Output

The output is a list of ***Passage*** objects, each containing:
- `title` (str): Same as input
- `text` (str): Chunked portion of the original text, within the specified token window
- Other metadata (e.g., community_id) is carried over

```json
[
    {
        "title": "Lithium Carbonate and Related Health Conditions",
        "text": "This report examines the interconnections between Lithium Carbonate, ..."
    },
    {
        "title": "Lithium Carbonate and Related Health Conditions",
        "text": "This duality necessitates careful monitoring of patients receiving Lithium treatment, ..."
    },

## üîç Passage Retrieval

### Overview

The **Passage Retrieval** module searches for the top-k most **relevant chunks** given a user query.  
It uses lexical or dense retrievers (e.g., BM25, Contriever) to compute semantic similarity between queries and chunks using embedding-based methods.

### How to Use

**(1) Indexing**:

```python
from kapipe.passage_retrieval import Contriever

INDEX_ROOT = "./"
INDEX_NAME = "example"

# Initialize retriever
retriever = Contriever(
    max_passage_length=512,
    pooling_method="average",
    normalize=False,
    gpu_id=0,
    metric="inner-product"
)

# Build index
retriever.make_index(
    passages=passages,
    index_root=INDEX_ROOT,
    index_name=INDEX_NAME
)
```
(See `experiments/codes/run_passage_retrieval.py` for specific examples.)

**(2) Search**:

```python
# Load the index
retriever.load_index(index_root=INDEX_ROOT, index_name=INDEX_NAME)

# Search for top-k contexts
retrieved_passages = retriever.search(queries=[question], top_k=10)[0]
contexts_for_question = {
    "question_key": question["question_key"],
    "contexts": retrieved_passages
}
```

### Input

**(1) Indexing**:

During the indexing phase, this module takes as input:

1. List of ***Passage*** objects

**(2) Search**:

During the search phase, this module takes as input:

1. ***Question***, or a dictionary containing:
    - `question_key` (str): Unique identifier for the question
    - `question` (str): Natural language question

```json
{
    "question_key": "question#123",
    "question": "What does lithium carbonate induce?"
}
```
(See `experiments/data/examples/questions.json` for more details.)

### Output

**(1) Indexing**:

The indexing result is automatically saved to the path specified by `index_root` and `index_name`.

**(2) Search**:

The search result for each question is represented as a dictionary containing:
- `question_key` (str): Refers back to the original query
- `contexts` (list[***Passage***]): Top-k retrieved chunks sorted by relevance, each containing:
    - `title` (str): Chunk title
    - `text` (str): Chunk text
    - `score` (float): Similarity score computed by the retriever
    - `rank` (int): Rank of the chunk (1-based)

```json
{
    "question_key": "question#123",
    "contexts": [
        {
            "title": "Lithium Carbonate and Related Health Conditions",
            "text": "This report examines the interconnections between Lithium Carbonate, ...",
            (meta data, if exists)
            "score": 1.5991605520248413,
            "rank": 1
        },
        {
            "title": "Lithium Carbonate and Related Health Conditions",
            "text": "\n\nIn summary, while Lithium Carbonate is an effective treatment for mood disorders, ...",
            (meta data, if exists)
            "score": 1.51018488407135,
            "rank": 2
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
(See `experiments/data/examples/questions.contexts.json` for more details.)

### Supported Methods

- **BM25**
    - A sparse lexical matching model based on term frequency and inverse document frequency.
- **Contriever** (Izacard et al., 2022)
    - A dual-encoder retriever trained with contrastive learning (Izacard et al., 2022). Computes similarity between query and chunk embeddings.
- **ColBERTv2** (Santhanam et al., 2022)
    - A token-level late-interaction retriever for fine-grained semantic matching. Provides higher accuracy with increased inference cost.
    - Note: This method is currently unavailable due to an import error in the external `ragatouille` package ([here](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/RAGatouille/issues/272)).

## üí¨ Question Answering

### Overview

The **Question Answering** module generates an answer for each user query, optionally conditioned on the retrieved context chunks.  
It uses a large language model such as GPT-4o to produce factually grounded and context-aware answers in natural language.

### How to Use

```python
from os.path import expanduser
from kapipe.qa import QA
from kapipe import utils

# Initialize the QA module
answerer = QA(identifier="gpt4o_with_context")

# Generate answer
answer = answerer.answer(
    question=question,
    contexts_for_question=contexts_for_question
)

```
(See `experiments/codes/run_qa.py` for specific examples.)

### Input

This module takes as input:

1. ***Question***, or a dictionary containing:
    - `question_key`: Unique identifier for the question
    - `question`: Natural language question string

(See `experiments/data/examples/questions.json` for more details.)

2. A dictionary containing:
    - `question_key`: The same identifier with the ***Question***
    - `contexts`: List of ***Passage*** objects

(See `experiments/data/examples/questions.contexts.json` for more details.)

### Output

The answer is a dictionary containing:

- `question_key` (str): Same as input
- `question` (str): Original question text
- `output_answer` (str): Model-generated natural language answer
- `helpfulness_score` (float): Confidence score generated by the model

```json
{
    "question_key": "question#123",
    "question": "What does lithium carbonate induce?",
    "output_answer": "Lithium carbonate can induce depressive disorder, cyanosis, and cardiac arrhythmias.",
    "helpfulness_score": 1.0
}
```
(See `experiments/data/examples/answers.json` for more details.)
