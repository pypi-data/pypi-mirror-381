### Instruction

Write a comprehensive report of a community, given a list of entities that belong to the community as well as their relationships. The report will be used to inform decision-makers about information associated with the community and their potential impact.

The report should be written in plain text and include the following two sections, each clearly marked with the section header:

TITLE:
A community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.

REPORT:
A comprehensive plain-text report that includes:
- An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant information associated with its entities.
- 1-3 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text. Be comprehensive.

Do not output JSON. The output must contain exactly two sections, starting with `TITLE:` followed by `REPORT:`.
