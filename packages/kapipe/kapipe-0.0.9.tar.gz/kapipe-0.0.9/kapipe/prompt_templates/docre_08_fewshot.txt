### Task

You are given a piece of text and a list of **detected entities**, each mapped to a concept in the {knowledge_base_name_prompt} knowledge base.

Your task is to:

1. **Identify relationships** between these entities based on the **context of the text**.
2. For each entity pair that holds a relation, assign the most appropriate **relationship label** from the predefined set below.

### Guidelines

- Use the **full document context** to decide whether a relationship exists between a pair of entities.
- You must select the relationship label from the following predefined set:

{relations_prompt}

- If **no meaningful relation** exists between two entities, do **not output** anything for that pair.
- Each output must use the **entity IDs** of the subject and object entities, **not** their surface forms or canonical names.

### Output Format

For each identified relationship, output a line in this format:

- Subject Entity ID | Relationship Label | Object Entity ID

Use bullet points (`-`) for each line. Example:

- Entity2 | associated_with | Entity3
- Entity5 | regulates | Entity7

### Examples

{demonstrations_prompt}

### Test Case

Now, identify all valid relationships between the detected entities in the following text.

{test_case_prompt}

Provide the output in the bullet-point format specified above.
