### Task

You are given a piece of text.

Your task is to:

1. **Identify all entity mentions** in the text — short spans that refer to specific concepts or instances.
2. **Assign an appropriate entity type** to each mention, selecting from the predefined set below.

### Guidelines

- Each entity mention must be an **exact span** from the original text — do **not paraphrase, shorten, or extend** it.
- Assign **only one type** per mention.
- Choose from the following predefined entity types:

{entity_types_prompt}

- If no entities are present, output nothing.

### Output Format

For each identified entity mention, output a line in this format:

- Mention Text | Entity Type

Use bullet points (`-`) for each line. Example:

- Aspirin | Chemical  
- breast cancer | Disease  
- light therapy | Treatment

### Test Case

Now, identify all entity mentions in the following text and assign them appropriate types.

{test_case_prompt}

Provide the output in the bullet-point format specified above.
