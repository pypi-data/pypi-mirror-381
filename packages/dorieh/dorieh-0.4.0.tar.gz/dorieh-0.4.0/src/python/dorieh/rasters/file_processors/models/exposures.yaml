        Estimated annual and monthly ground-level fine particulate matter
        (PM2.5) for 1998-2020 by combining Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)
        retrievals from the NASA MODIS, MISR, and SeaWIFS instruments with
        the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, and subsequently calibrating
        to global ground-based observations using a Geographically Weighted
        Regression (GWR), as detailed in the below reference for V5.GL.01.
        V5.GL.02 follows the methodology of V5.GL.01, but updates the
        ground-based observations used to calibrate the geophysical PM2.5
        estimates for the entire time series, and extends temporal
        coverage through 2020.
