# Faraday Agent Parameters Types

The [faraday agents][dispatcher] run code remotely to secure your domains. This info is triggered and published to a
[faraday server][faraday] instance, which had set the parameters of the code. This repository sets the models to
be used by both sides.


Features
--------

* Set the models of parameters types for the agents:
    * How to pass them by identifier strings
    * How to encode/decode them to pass data between the [Faraday server][faraday], and the [agents][dispatcher]

Credits

This package was created with [Cookiecutter][cookiecutter] and the
[`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`][cookiecutter-pypackage] project template.
