## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story: Commit Review & Scoring
A developer wants to improve their commit message quality. They run a review command on recent commits to get feedback on what makes a good commit message. The system:
1. Analyzes each commit message in the specified range
2. Scores each message (0-100) based on quality criteria
3. Identifies specific issues (vague descriptions, missing scopes, incorrect grammatical mood)
4. Suggests concrete improvements for problematic commits
5. Optionally integrates into CI/CD to block low-quality commits in pull requests

### Primary User Story: Smart Commit Splitting
A developer has made many changes and forgot to commit incrementally. Instead of creating one massive commit, they want the system to intelligently split changes into logical, atomic commits. The system:
1. Analyzes the entire staged diff
2. Groups changes by logical units (features, fixes, refactorings)
3. Suggests separate commits for each logical unit
4. Generates appropriate commit messages for each split
5. Allows interactive review and adjustment before creating commits

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Commit Review
1. **Given** a repository with 5 recent commits, **When** user runs review on last 5 commits, **Then** system displays quality scores (0-100) for each commit with specific feedback

2. **Given** a commit message "fixed stuff", **When** system reviews it, **Then** system identifies issues: "too vague" (no specific description), "missing scope" (no scope specified), "wrong mood" (past tense instead of imperative)

3. **Given** a poorly-scored commit (score < 50), **When** system reviews it, **Then** system suggests improved version: "fix(auth): resolve token expiration edge case"

4. **Given** a pull request with 10 commits, **When** CI runs review in strict mode, **Then** PR is blocked if average commit score < 70 with clear report of issues

5. **Given** a well-formatted commit following conventional commits, **When** system reviews it, **Then** system gives high score (90+) and confirms good practices used

#### Smart Commit Splitting
6. **Given** staged changes affecting 10 files with mixed purposes, **When** user requests auto-split, **Then** system groups changes into 3 logical commits (e.g., 1 feature, 1 fix, 1 refactor)

7. **Given** a large diff with only feature additions, **When** user requests split, **Then** system creates single commit (no artificial splitting of cohesive changes)

8. **Given** split suggestions from the system, **When** user reviews in interactive mode, **Then** user can adjust groupings, merge splits, or reject suggestions before committing

9. **Given** changes to 5 unrelated files, **When** system splits commits, **Then** each commit message accurately describes only the files included in that commit

10. **Given** a mix of breaking changes and non-breaking changes, **When** system splits commits, **Then** breaking changes are isolated in separate commits with appropriate markers

### Edge Cases

#### Commit Review
- What happens when reviewing merge commits? ‚Üí System should detect merge commits and optionally skip them or apply different scoring criteria
- How does system handle commits with very long bodies (>1000 chars)? ‚Üí System should analyze structure and coherence, not penalize length if content is valuable
- What if commit is in a non-English language? ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: language support requirements - English only or multi-language?]
- What about commits from bots/automated systems? ‚Üí System should detect bot signatures and optionally skip or score differently
- How to handle conventional commit variants (Angular style vs other formats)? ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which commit formats to support - strict conventional commits only or multiple standards?]

#### Smart Commit Splitting
- What happens when diff is too large (10,000+ lines)? ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: max diff size for splitting - should system refuse or sample intelligently?]
- How does system handle binary file changes mixed with code changes? ‚Üí Binary files should be grouped separately from code changes
- What if changes span refactoring + feature addition in same file? ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: granularity preference - split by file sections or keep file-level changes together?]
- What about uncommitted changes in working directory (unstaged)? ‚Üí System should only analyze staged changes and warn about unstaged changes
- How to split when dependencies exist between changes? ‚Üí System should detect dependencies and keep dependent changes in same commit

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements: Commit Review

**Core Analysis**
- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze commit messages in a specified range (e.g., HEAD~5..HEAD)
- **FR-002**: System MUST score each commit message on a 0-100 scale
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify specific issues: vague descriptions, missing scopes, incorrect mood (past/present vs imperative)
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate improved versions of problematic commit messages
- **FR-005**: System MUST support reviewing individual commits, commit ranges, and entire branches

**Quality Criteria**
- **FR-006**: System MUST evaluate commit messages against conventional commit format (type, scope, description)
- **FR-007**: System MUST check for imperative mood in commit subject line
- **FR-008**: System MUST detect overly vague terms (e.g., "stuff", "things", "fixes")
- **FR-009**: System MUST verify appropriate commit type selection (feat/fix/docs/etc.)
- **FR-010**: System MUST assess description specificity and technical accuracy

**Output & Reporting**
- **FR-011**: System MUST display results in human-readable format with scores and issue descriptions
- **FR-012**: System MUST support JSON output format for CI/CD integration
- **FR-013**: System MUST show before/after examples for suggested improvements
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide aggregate statistics (average score, most common issues)
- **FR-015**: System MUST support verbose mode showing detailed scoring breakdown

**CI/CD Integration**
- **FR-016**: System MUST support strict mode that exits with non-zero code if commits fail quality threshold
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow configurable minimum score threshold (default: 70)
- **FR-018**: System MUST generate reports suitable for PR comments (markdown format)
- **FR-019**: System MUST detect CI environment and adjust output accordingly

### Functional Requirements: Smart Commit Splitting

**Core Splitting Logic**
- **FR-020**: System MUST analyze entire staged diff and identify logical groupings
- **FR-021**: System MUST group changes by purpose: features, fixes, refactoring, documentation, tests, chores
- **FR-022**: System MUST create separate commits for unrelated changes
- **FR-023**: System MUST generate appropriate commit messages for each split
- **FR-024**: System MUST preserve file-level atomicity (don't split individual files unless explicitly requested)

**Interactive Mode**
- **FR-025**: System MUST provide interactive mode showing proposed splits before committing
- **FR-026**: Users MUST be able to adjust groupings (move files between splits)
- **FR-027**: Users MUST be able to merge proposed splits
- **FR-028**: Users MUST be able to reject splits and keep original staging
- **FR-029**: System MUST allow editing generated commit messages before finalizing

**Automatic Mode**
- **FR-030**: System MUST support fully automatic splitting without user interaction
- **FR-031**: System MUST create commits in logical dependency order
- **FR-032**: System MUST handle errors gracefully (if commit fails, don't lose changes)
- **FR-033**: System MUST provide dry-run mode showing what would be committed without making changes

**Safety & Validation**
- **FR-034**: System MUST verify all staged changes are accounted for in splits
- **FR-035**: System MUST detect when splitting is not beneficial (cohesive changes) and recommend single commit
- **FR-036**: System MUST warn if splits would break build/tests (if detectable)
- **FR-037**: System MUST preserve git user identity (name, email) when creating commits

### Key Entities

- **CommitReview**: Represents the analysis result for a single commit (commit hash, original message, quality score, identified issues, suggested improvements, score breakdown by criteria)

- **QualityIssue**: Represents a specific problem found in a commit message (issue type: vague/missing_scope/wrong_mood/etc., severity: low/medium/high, description, location in message)

- **CommitSplit**: Represents a proposed logical grouping of changes (split ID, included files, change type: feat/fix/refactor/etc., generated commit message, dependency references to other splits)

- **ReviewReport**: Aggregate analysis across multiple commits (total commits analyzed, average score, score distribution, most common issues, improvement suggestions summary)
