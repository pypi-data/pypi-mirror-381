# Feature Specification: AI-Powered Git Commit Message Generator

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-commit-messages`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "CLI tool that analyzes git diff and generates meaningful commit messages using AI"

## Execution Status
- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted
- [x] Ambiguities marked
- [x] User scenarios defined
- [x] Requirements generated
- [x] Entities identified
- [x] Review checklist passed

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A developer has made changes to their codebase and wants to commit them with a descriptive message. Instead of manually crafting the commit message, they run a CLI command that:
1. Analyzes the staged git changes (diff)
2. Sends the changes to an AI service
3. Receives a generated commit message following conventional commit format
4. Displays the message for review/editing
5. Optionally creates the commit with the generated message

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a git repository with staged changes, **When** user runs `gitcommit-ai generate`, **Then** system displays an AI-generated commit message in conventional commit format (e.g., "feat: add user authentication endpoint")

2. **Given** a git repository with no staged changes, **When** user runs `gitcommit-ai generate`, **Then** system displays error "No staged changes to commit"

3. **Given** an AI-generated commit message, **When** user approves it, **Then** system creates a git commit with that message

4. **Given** an AI-generated commit message, **When** user requests to edit it, **Then** system opens the message in their default editor before committing

5. **Given** multiple types of changes (features, fixes, docs), **When** AI generates message, **Then** message uses appropriate conventional commit type (feat/fix/docs/etc.)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when git diff is too large (>10,000 lines)? → System should truncate or sample the diff intelligently
- How does system handle AI API failures (rate limits, network errors)? → Graceful fallback with clear error messages
- What if API key is missing? → Clear error message directing user to configuration
- What if repository has both staged and unstaged changes? → Only analyze staged changes, warn about unstaged
- What about merge commits or rebases? → Detect special git states and provide context-appropriate messages

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Functionality**
- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze git staged changes (diff) from the current repository
- **FR-002**: System MUST send diff content to AI provider API for analysis
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate commit messages following conventional commit format (type(scope): description)
- **FR-004**: System MUST display generated commit message to user before committing
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow user to approve, edit, or reject the generated message

**Git Integration**
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect when not in a git repository and display appropriate error
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect when no changes are staged and prompt user
- **FR-008**: System MUST support creating the commit with generated message (optional behavior)
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve git user identity (name, email) when creating commits

**AI Integration**
- **FR-010**: System MUST support OpenAI API as primary provider
- **FR-011**: System MUST support Anthropic API as secondary provider
- **FR-012**: System MUST read API keys from environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle API failures gracefully with actionable error messages

**Output & Interaction**
- **FR-014**: System MUST output messages in human-readable format by default
- **FR-015**: System MUST support JSON output format for scripting (--json flag)
- **FR-016**: System MUST exit with code 0 on success, non-zero on failure
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide verbose mode (--verbose) showing API requests and responses

**Configuration**
- **FR-018**: User MUST be able to specify preferred AI provider via configuration or flag
- **FR-019**: User MUST be able to configure commit message style preferences [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what customization options? max length, tone, emoji usage?]
- **FR-020**: System MUST validate configuration on startup and report missing required values

### Key Entities

- **GitDiff**: Represents the staged changes in a repository (added lines, removed lines, affected files, change type)
- **CommitMessage**: Structured representation of a commit message (type, scope, description, body, breaking changes)
- **AIProvider**: Abstraction for AI services (provider name, API endpoint, authentication credentials)
- **Configuration**: User preferences (default provider, API keys, style settings, verbosity)

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (FR-019 needs clarification on style preferences)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (except FR-019)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (MVP: generate and commit, no UI beyond CLI)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (assumes git installed, API keys available, internet access)

---

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Graphical user interface
- Commit message history/learning from past commits
- Multi-repository support (runs in current repo only)
- Integration with GitHub PR descriptions
- Custom AI model training or fine-tuning
- Offline mode or local AI models
