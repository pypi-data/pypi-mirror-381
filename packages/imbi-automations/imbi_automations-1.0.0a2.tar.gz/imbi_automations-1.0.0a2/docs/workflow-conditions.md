# Workflow Conditions

Conditions check repository state to determine if workflows or individual actions should execute. They provide fine-grained control over workflow execution based on file existence, file contents, and repository structure.

## Condition Levels

Conditions can be applied at two levels:

### Workflow-Level Conditions
Evaluated once per project before any actions execute. If conditions fail, the entire workflow is skipped.

```toml
[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "setup.cfg"
```

### Action-Level Conditions
Evaluated before each action executes. If conditions fail, only that specific action is skipped.

```toml
[[actions]]
name = "update-dockerfile"
type = "file"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_exists = "Dockerfile"
```

## Condition Types

### Remote Conditions (Pre-Clone)

Remote conditions are checked via API before cloning the repository. They are **faster** and more **efficient** than local conditions.

**Advantages:**

- ‚ö° No repository cloning required
- üíæ Saves bandwidth and disk space
- üöÄ Faster workflow evaluation
- ‚úÖ Early filtering (fail fast)

**Limitations:**

- Limited to single file content checks
- No glob pattern support for content matching
- API rate limits may apply

#### remote_file_exists

Check if a file exists using GitHub/GitLab API.

**Type:** `string` (file path or glob pattern)


```toml
[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "setup.cfg"
```

**Glob pattern support:**
```toml
[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "**/*.tf"  # Any Terraform file recursively
```

**Real-world example:**
```toml
[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "setup.cfg"
```

**Why?** Workflow migrates projects from setup.cfg to pyproject.toml, so it only runs on projects that still have setup.cfg.

#### remote_file_not_exists

Check if a file does NOT exist using GitHub/GitLab API.

**Type:** `string` (file path or glob pattern)


```toml
[[conditions]]
remote_file_not_exists = "pyproject.toml"
```

**Real-world example:**
```toml
[[conditions]]
remote_file_not_exists = "pyproject.toml"
```

**Why?** Combined with `remote_file_exists = "setup.cfg"`, this targets projects that haven't been migrated yet (have setup.cfg but no pyproject.toml).

#### remote_file_contains + remote_file

Check if a file contains specific text or matches a regex pattern.

**Type:** `string` (pattern to search for)

**Requires:** `remote_file` field with target file path


```toml
[[conditions]]
remote_file_contains = "python.*3\\.9"
remote_file = "setup.cfg"
```

**Pattern matching:**

1. String search first (fast)
2. Falls back to regex if string not found
3. Use regex escaping: `\\.` for literal `.`, `\\d` for digits

**Example - exact string:**
```toml
[[conditions]]
remote_file_contains = "FROM python:3.9"
remote_file = "Dockerfile"
```

**Example - regex pattern:**
```toml
[[conditions]]
remote_file_contains = "python_requires.*=[\"']>=3\\.(9|10)"
remote_file = "setup.cfg"
```

#### remote_file_doesnt_contain + remote_file

Check if a file does NOT contain a pattern.

```toml
[[conditions]]
remote_file_doesnt_contain = "python.*3\\.12"
remote_file = "pyproject.toml"
```

#### remote_client

Specify which API client to use for remote checks.

**Type:** `string`

**Values:** `"github"` (default), `"gitlab"`


```toml
[[conditions]]
remote_client = "gitlab"
remote_file_exists = ".gitlab-ci.yml"
```

### Local Conditions (Post-Clone)

Local conditions are checked after cloning the repository. They have **full filesystem access** and support **glob patterns**.

**Advantages:**

- ‚úÖ Full glob pattern support
- ‚úÖ Access to all files, even .gitignored
- ‚úÖ Complex pattern matching
- ‚úÖ Directory checks

**Disadvantages:**

- üêå Requires git clone first
- üíæ Uses bandwidth and disk space
- ‚è±Ô∏è Slower than remote conditions

#### file_exists

Check if a file or directory exists locally.

**Type:** [`ResourceUrl`](actions/index.md#resourceurl-path-system) (path relative to repository)

**Supports:** Glob patterns


```toml
[[conditions]]
file_exists = "Dockerfile"
```

**Glob patterns:**
```toml
[[conditions]]
file_exists = "**/*.py"  # Any Python file recursively

[[conditions]]
file_exists = "src/**/__init__.py"  # __init__.py in any src subdirectory
```

**Real-world example from example-workflow (action-level):**
```toml
[[actions]]
name = "extract-constraints"
type = "docker"
command = "extract"
image = "{{ extract_image_from_dockerfile('repository/Dockerfile') }}"
source = "/tmp/constraints.txt"
destination = "extracted:///constraints.txt"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_exists = "Dockerfile"
```

**Why?** Only extract Docker constraints if project has a Dockerfile.

#### file_not_exists

Check if a file or directory does NOT exist locally.

```toml
[[conditions]]
file_not_exists = ".travis.yml"  # No legacy CI
```

**Real-world example from example-workflow (action-level):**
```toml
[[actions]]
name = "extract-original-compose-yml"
type = "git"
command = "extract"
commit_keyword = "migration"
source = "compose.yml"
destination = "extracted:///compose.original.yaml"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_not_exists = "extracted:///compose.original.yaml"
```

**Why?** Only attempt to extract compose.yml from git history if we haven't already extracted it from a previous attempt (compose.yaml).

#### file_contains + file

Check if a file contains specific text or matches a regex pattern.

**Type:** `string` (pattern to search for)

**Requires:** `file` field with target file path


```toml
[[conditions]]
file_contains = "FROM python:3\\.9"
file = "Dockerfile"
```

**Pattern matching:**

1. String search first (fast)
2. Falls back to regex if string not found
3. Use regex escaping: `\\.` for literal `.`, `\\d` for digits

**Example - Check Python version:**
```toml
[[conditions]]
file_contains = "python.*3\\.(9|10|11)"
file = "pyproject.toml"
```

**Example - Check dependencies:**
```toml
[[conditions]]
file_contains = "fastapi.*==.*0\\."
file = "requirements.txt"
```

#### file_doesnt_contain + file

Check if a file does NOT contain a pattern.

```toml
[[conditions]]
file_doesnt_contain = "python.*2\\."
file = "setup.py"
```

## Condition Evaluation

### condition_type

Controls how multiple conditions are evaluated.

**Type:** `string`

**Values:** `"all"` (AND logic), `"any"` (OR logic)

**Default:** `"all"`


#### AND Logic (condition_type = "all")

ALL conditions must pass for execution to proceed.

```toml
condition_type = "all"  # All conditions must pass (default)

[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "setup.cfg"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_not_exists = "pyproject.toml"
```

**Real-world example:**
```toml
# Workflow level - targets un-migrated projects
[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "setup.cfg"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_not_exists = "pyproject.toml"
```

**Result:** Only processes projects that have setup.cfg AND don't have pyproject.toml (haven't been migrated yet).

#### OR Logic (condition_type = "any")

ANY ONE condition passing is sufficient for execution.

```toml
condition_type = "any"  # Any condition passing is sufficient

[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "requirements.txt"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "pyproject.toml"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "setup.py"
```

**Result:** Executes if project has ANY Python configuration file.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Workflow-Level Conditions (example-workflow)

```toml
# Only target Python projects that still use setup.cfg
[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "setup.cfg"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_not_exists = "pyproject.toml"
```

**What it does:**

1. ‚úÖ Project must have `setup.cfg` (old configuration)
2. ‚úÖ Project must NOT have `pyproject.toml` (not yet migrated)

**Why remote conditions?** These checks happen before cloning, so we avoid cloning projects that don't need migration. For 1000 projects, this might only clone 50 that need fixing.

### Example 2: Action-Level Conditions (Conditional Docker Extraction)

```toml
[[actions]]
name = "extract-constraints"
type = "docker"
command = "extract"
image = "{{ extract_image_from_dockerfile('repository/Dockerfile') }}"
source = "/tmp/constraints.txt"
destination = "extracted:///constraints.txt"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_exists = "Dockerfile"
```

**What it does:**

- Only extracts Docker constraints if project has a Dockerfile
- If no Dockerfile, action is skipped (not a failure)

**Why action-level?** Not all Python projects use Docker, so this action should only run when applicable.

### Example 3: Multiple Action Conditions (Compose File Variations)

```toml
[[actions]]
name = "extract-original-docker-compose-yml"
type = "git"
command = "extract"
commit_keyword = "migration"
source = "docker-compose.yml"
destination = "extracted:///compose.original.yaml"
ignore_errors = true

[[actions.conditions]]
file_not_exists = "extracted:///compose.original.yaml"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_exists = "repository:///compose.yaml"
```

**What it does:**

1. ‚úÖ Only extract if we haven't already extracted a compose file
2. ‚úÖ Only extract if project currently has compose.yaml

**Why both conditions?** Projects might have compose.yaml, compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml, or docker-compose.yml. The workflow tries each variant in sequence, but stops once one succeeds.

### Example 4: Conditional Dockerfile Update

```toml
[[actions]]
name = "generate-dockerfile"
type = "claude"
prompt = "prompts/dockerfile.md.j2"
validation_prompt = "prompts/validate-dockerfile.md.j2"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_exists = "repository:///Dockerfile"
```

**What it does:**

- Only runs Claude to update Dockerfile if project has one
- Projects without Docker are skipped gracefully

**Why ResourceUrl?** The `repository:///` prefix ensures we're checking the cloned repository, not extracted files.

### Example 5: Multiple Condition Fallbacks

This pattern from example-workflow tries multiple compose file names:

```toml
# Try compose.yaml first
[[actions]]
name = "extract-original-compose-yaml"
type = "git"
command = "extract"
source = "compose.yaml"
destination = "extracted:///compose.original.yaml"

# Try compose.yml if compose.yaml wasn't found
[[actions]]
name = "extract-original-compose-yml"
type = "git"
command = "extract"
source = "compose.yml"
destination = "extracted:///compose.original.yaml"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_not_exists = "extracted:///compose.original.yaml"  # Only if previous failed

# Try docker-compose.yaml
[[actions]]
name = "extract-original-docker-compose-yaml"
type = "git"
command = "extract"
source = "docker-compose.yaml"
destination = "extracted:///compose.original.yaml"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_not_exists = "extracted:///compose.original.yaml"

# Try docker-compose.yml
[[actions]]
name = "extract-original-docker-compose-yml"
type = "git"
command = "extract"
source = "docker-compose.yml"
destination = "extracted:///compose.original.yaml"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_not_exists = "extracted:///compose.original.yaml"
```

**What it does:**

1. Try `compose.yaml` (modern name)
2. If that fails, try `compose.yml`
3. If that fails, try `docker-compose.yaml`
4. If that fails, try `docker-compose.yml`
5. Stop at first success

**Why this pattern?** Docker Compose supports multiple filenames, and different projects use different conventions. This ensures we find the file regardless of naming.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Remote Conditions First

```toml
# ‚úÖ Good - check remotely before cloning
[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "package.json"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_contains = "node.*18"
remote_file = ".nvmrc"

# ‚ùå Slower - clones every repository
[[conditions]]
file_exists = "package.json"

[[conditions]]
file_contains = "node.*18"
file = ".nvmrc"
```

**Performance impact:** For 1000 projects, remote conditions might process 50, while local conditions require cloning all 1000 first.

### 2. Combine AND Logic for Precision

```toml
condition_type = "all"  # All must pass (default)

[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "Dockerfile"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_contains = "FROM python:3\\.9"
remote_file = "Dockerfile"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_not_exists = "pyproject.toml"
```

**Result:** Only Python 3.9 Docker projects without pyproject.toml.

### 3. Use OR Logic for Flexibility

```toml
condition_type = "any"  # Any one passing is sufficient

[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "setup.py"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "setup.cfg"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "pyproject.toml"
```

**Result:** Any Python project with configuration.

### 4. Action Conditions for Optional Steps

```toml
[[actions]]
name = "update-dockerfile"
type = "file"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_exists = "Dockerfile"  # Skip if no Docker

[[actions]]
name = "run-tests"
type = "shell"
command = "pytest tests/"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_exists = "tests/"  # Skip if no tests
```

**Why?** Not all projects need all actions. Conditions allow graceful degradation.

### 5. Avoid Over-Filtering

```toml
# ‚ùå Too restrictive - might miss valid projects
[[conditions]]
remote_file_contains = "python_requires.*=.*['\"]3\\.9['\"]"
remote_file = "setup.cfg"

# ‚úÖ Better - allows variations
[[conditions]]
remote_file_contains = "python.*3\\.9"
remote_file = "setup.cfg"
```

**Why?** The second pattern matches more variations in how version might be specified.

## Condition vs Filter

| Feature | Filters | Remote Conditions | Local Conditions |
|---------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **When evaluated** | Before processing | Before cloning | After cloning |
| **Data source** | Imbi metadata | GitHub/GitLab API | Local filesystem |
| **Speed** | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° Fastest | ‚ö°‚ö° Fast | ‚ö° Slower |
| **Use for** | Project metadata | File existence/content | Complex patterns |
| **Glob support** | No | Limited | Full |
| **Bandwidth** | None | Minimal | High |

**Best practice:** Use all three in combination:

1. **Filters** for broad technology targeting
2. **Remote conditions** for file-based applicability
3. **Local conditions** for complex repository checks

## Complete Example

This is the actual condition strategy from example-workflow:

```toml
# Filter: Broad targeting
[filter]
project_types = ["apis", "consumers", ...]
project_facts = {"programming_language" = "Python 3.9"}
github_identifier_required = true
github_workflow_status_exclude = ["success"]

# Workflow conditions: Migration applicability
[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "setup.cfg"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_not_exists = "pyproject.toml"

# Action conditions: Optional steps
[[actions]]
name = "extract-constraints"
type = "docker"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_exists = "Dockerfile"  # Only if Docker is used

[[actions]]
name = "ensure-correct-pins"
type = "claude"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_exists = "Dockerfile"  # Only if Docker is used

[[actions]]
name = "generate-dockerfile"
type = "claude"

[[actions.conditions]]
file_exists = "repository:///Dockerfile"  # Only if Dockerfile exists
```

**Result:**

1. Filter reduces 1000 projects ‚Üí 50 Python 3.9 projects with failing builds
2. Remote conditions reduce 50 projects ‚Üí 30 projects needing migration (have setup.cfg, no pyproject.toml)
3. Action conditions skip Docker-related actions for non-Docker projects
