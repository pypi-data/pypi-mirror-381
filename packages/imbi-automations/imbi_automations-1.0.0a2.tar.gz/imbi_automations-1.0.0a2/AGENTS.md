### Configuration Structure

The tool uses TOML configuration files with Pydantic validation:

```toml
[github]
api_key = "ghp_..."
hostname = "github.com"  # Optional, defaults to github.com

[imbi]
api_key = "uuid-here"
hostname = "imbi.example.com"

[claude_code]
executable = "claude"  # Optional, defaults to 'claude'
```

### Transformation Architecture

The system supports multiple transformation types through the workflow action system:

1. **Callable Actions** (`actions/callablea.py`): Direct method calls on client instances with dynamic kwargs
2. **Claude Actions** (`actions/claude.py`): Complex multi-file analysis and transformation using Claude Code SDK
3. **Docker Actions** (`actions/docker.py`): Container-based file extraction and manipulation
4. **File Actions** (`actions/filea.py`): Direct file manipulation (copy with glob patterns, move, delete, regex replacement)
5. **Git Actions** (`actions/git.py`): Version control operations (revert, extract, branch management)
6. **GitHub Actions** (`actions/github.py`): GitHub-specific operations and API integrations
7. **Imbi Actions** (`actions/imbi.py`): Imbi project fact management with validated fact names and enum values
8. **Shell Actions** (`actions/shell.py`): Shell command execution with glob expansion (uses subprocess_shell for pattern support)
9. **Template Actions** (`actions/template.py`): Jinja2-based file generation with full project context
10. **Utility Actions** (`actions/utility.py`): Helper operations for common workflow tasks

All actions are dispatched through the centralized `Actions` class (`actions/__init__.py`) which uses Python 3.12's match/case pattern for type-safe routing.

#### File Action Usage

File actions manipulate files with glob pattern support:

```toml
# Copy single file from workflow to repository
[[actions]]
name = "copy-gitignore"
type = "file"
command = "copy"
source = "workflow/.gitignore"              # From workflow directory
destination = "repository/.gitignore"       # To cloned repository

# Copy multiple files with glob pattern
[[actions]]
name = "copy-terraform-workflows"
type = "file"
command = "copy"
source = "workflow/terraform-*.yml"         # Glob pattern
destination = "repository/.github/workflows/"  # Directory

# Move file within repository
[[actions]]
name = "move-config"
type = "file"
command = "move"
source = "repository/old-config.yml"
destination = "repository/config/new-config.yml"
```

**Important Notes:**
- `source` and `destination` are relative to working directory
- Use `workflow/` prefix for files in your workflow directory
- Use `repository/` prefix for files in the cloned git repository
- Glob patterns supported: `*`, `?`, `[...]`, `**/` for recursive
- For glob patterns, destination must be a directory

#### Template Action Usage

Template actions render Jinja2 templates with full workflow context:

```toml
[[actions]]
name = "render-config"
type = "template"
source_path = "templates"                   # Directory (recursively renders all files)
# OR
source_path = "config.yaml.j2"              # Single file
destination_path = "repository/config/"     # Relative to working directory
```

**Important Notes:**
- `source_path` is relative to workflow directory
- `destination_path` is relative to working directory (temp directory root)
- For directories, use `"ci"` not `"ci/*"` (directory rendering is automatic)
- Template context includes: `workflow`, `github_repository`, `imbi_project`, `working_directory`, `starting_commit`

### Workflow Structure

Workflows are organized in a directory structure with TOML configuration files:

```
workflows/
├── workflow-name/
│   ├── config.toml                # Workflow definition with actions, conditions, and filters
│   └── files/                     # Optional: Template files and resources
└── another-workflow/
    └── config.toml
```

Each workflow's `config.toml` file contains:
- **Actions**: Sequence of operations to perform
- **Conditions**: Repository state requirements for execution
- **Filters**: Project targeting and filtering criteria

### Workflow Conditions

Workflows support conditional execution based on repository state. There are two types of conditions:

#### Local Conditions (Post-Clone)
Evaluated after cloning the repository:
- **`file_exists`**: Check if a file exists (supports exact paths, glob patterns like `**/*.tf`, or regex)
- **`file_not_exists`**: Check if a file does not exist (supports exact paths, glob patterns, or regex)
- **`file_contains`**: Check if a file contains specified text or matches a regex pattern

#### Remote Conditions (Pre-Clone)
Evaluated before cloning using GitHub API, providing performance benefits:
- **`remote_file_exists`**: Check if a file exists (supports exact paths or glob patterns like `**/*.tf`)
- **`remote_file_not_exists`**: Check if a file does not exist (supports exact paths or glob patterns)
- **`remote_file_contains`**: Check if a remote file contains specified text or regex pattern

#### File Contains Conditions (Local and Remote)

Both `file_contains` and `remote_file_contains` support string literals and regular expressions:

```toml
# Local conditions (require git clone)
[[conditions]]
file_exists = "package.json"

[[conditions]]
file_exists = "**/*.tf"  # Glob pattern - any .tf file recursively

[[conditions]]
file_not_exists = "*.pyc"  # Glob pattern - no .pyc files

[[conditions]]
file_contains = "compose.yml"
file = "bootstrap"

# Remote conditions (checked before cloning - more efficient)
[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "README.md"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "**/*.tf"  # Glob pattern - any .tf file recursively

[[conditions]]
remote_file_not_exists = "legacy-config.json"

[[conditions]]
remote_file_contains = "node.*18"
remote_file = ".nvmrc"

# Mixed local and remote conditions
[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = "package.json"  # Check remotely first

[[conditions]]
file_contains = "test.*script"       # Then check locally after clone
file = "package.json"
```

#### Advanced Pattern Examples

```toml
# Version checking with regex
[[conditions]]
remote_file_contains = "\"version\":\\s*\"\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\""
remote_file = "package.json"

# Docker base image checking
[[conditions]]
remote_file_contains = "FROM python:[3-4]\\.[0-9]+"
remote_file = "Dockerfile"

# GitHub Actions workflow detection
[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = ".github/workflows/ci.yml"

# Legacy file cleanup detection
[[conditions]]
remote_file_not_exists = ".travis.yml"  # No Travis CI
[[conditions]]
remote_file_exists = ".github/workflows"  # Has GitHub Actions
```

#### Performance Benefits

**Remote Conditions:**
- ⚡ **Faster**: GitHub API calls are faster than git clone
- 💾 **Bandwidth efficient**: Skip clone entirely for non-matching repos
- 🔄 **Early filtering**: Fail fast before expensive operations
- 🌐 **Glob support**: `remote_file_exists` and `remote_file_not_exists` support glob patterns via Git Trees API

**Best Practices:**
- Use remote conditions for initial filtering (file existence, basic content checks)
- Use local conditions for complex file analysis requiring full repository access
- Remote glob patterns (`**/*.tf`) use Git Trees API (100k file limit)
- String search is performed first (fast), with regex fallback only when string search fails
- Invalid regex patterns gracefully fall back to string search behavior

### Workflow Filtering

Workflows support filtering projects before execution to improve performance and target specific subsets:

```toml
[filter]
# Filter by specific project IDs
project_ids = [123, 456, 789]

# Filter by project types
project_types = ["apis", "consumers", "scheduled-jobs"]

# Filter by project facts (supports real names or slugs, validated against Registry)
project_facts = {
    "Programming Language" = "Python 3.12"  # Auto-normalized to "programming_language"
    "Framework" = "FastAPI"                 # Enum values validated at parse time
}

# Require GitHub identifier to be present
requires_github_identifier = true

# Exclude projects with specific GitHub workflow statuses
exclude_github_workflow_status = ["success"]
```

**Performance Benefits:**
- **Pre-filtering**: Projects are filtered before processing, not during each iteration
- **Batch efficiency**: "Found 664 total projects" → "Processing 50 filtered projects"
- **Multiple criteria**: All filter criteria must match (AND logic)
- **Early Validation**: Filter fields validated at parse time using Registry cache (catches typos before processing)

**Common Use Cases:**
```toml
# Target only Python 3.12 projects
[filter]
project_facts = {"Programming Language" = "Python 3.12"}

# Target APIs and consumers with GitHub repos
[filter]
project_types = ["apis", "consumers"]
requires_github_identifier = true

# Only process projects with failing builds (exclude working ones)
[filter]
exclude_github_workflow_status = ["success"]
```

## Code Style and Standards

- **Line length**: 79 characters (enforced by ruff)
- **Python version**: 3.12+ required
- **Type hints**: Required for all functions and methods
- **Quotes**: Single quotes preferred, double quotes for docstrings
- **Import organization**: Use module imports over direct class/function imports
- **Logging**: Use module-level LOGGER, colored logging for CLI applications
- **Error handling**: Use specific exception types, include context in log messages

## Testing Infrastructure

- **Base class**: `AsyncTestCase` inherits from `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase`
- **HTTP mocking**: Uses `httpx.MockTransport` with JSON fixture files in `tests/data/`
- **Mock data**: Path-based JSON files matching URL endpoints
- **Async support**: Full asyncio test support with proper teardown
- **Test isolation**: HTTP client instances cleared between tests

## Key Implementation Notes

- **HTTP Client Pattern**: Singleton pattern with instance caching (`_instances.clear()`)
- **URL Sanitization**: Passwords masked in logs using regex pattern replacement
- **Configuration Loading**: TOML files loaded with tomllib, validated with Pydantic
- **Colored Logging**: Uses colorlog for CLI output with different colors per log level
- **Directory Management**: Automatic parent directory creation with proper error handling
- **Authentication**: Secret string handling for API keys in configuration
- **Pattern-Aware File Detection**: GitHub client supports both exact file paths and regex patterns for workflow file detection
- **Resumable Processing**: `--start-from-project` CLI option allows resuming batch processing from a specific project slug

All Claude Code actions follow standards defined in the `prompts/CLAUDE.md` file, including:

- **Failure Indication**: Create failure files (`ACTION_FAILED`, `{ACTION_NAME}_FAILED`, etc.) to signal workflow abortion
- **Success Indication**: No action required - successful completion is implicit when no failure files are created
- **Template Variables**: Ensure all Jinja2 variables are properly resolved in generated content

## Key Implementation Details

### Imbi Metadata Cache System
The `ImbiMetadataCache` class (`imc.py`) provides singleton caching of Imbi metadata:

**Cached Data** (stored in `~/.cache/imbi-automations/metadata.json`):
- **Environments**: All Imbi environments for filter validation
- **Project Types**: All project type slugs with IDs
- **Fact Types**: Complete fact type definitions with project_type_ids
- **Fact Type Enums**: All enum values for enum-type facts
- **Fact Type Ranges**: Min/max bounds for range-type facts

**Features**:
- **15-minute TTL**: Auto-refreshes when expired
- **Singleton Pattern**: One cache instance per process
- **Parse-Time Validation**: Validates filters before workflow execution
- **Handles Duplicates**: Multiple fact types with same name (different project types)
- **Property Access**: `imc.project_type_slugs`, `imc.environments`, `imc.project_fact_type_names`

**Usage in Validation**:
- WorkflowFilter validates project_types and project_facts at parse time
- Controller validates --project-type CLI argument before processing
- Provides helpful suggestions for typos

### Imbi Fact Management
Project facts support three validation modes:

1. **Enum Facts**: Values validated against allowed enum list
   - Example: "Programming Language" with values ["Python 3.9", "Python 3.12", "ES2015+", ...]
   - Multiple definitions per name (different project types get different enums)
   - Validation uses combined enum values from all definitions

2. **Range Facts**: Numeric values validated against min/max bounds
   - Example: "Test Coverage" range 0-100
   - Requires decimal or integer data type

3. **Free-Form Facts**: Type coercion only, no value constraints
   - Example: Custom notes, timestamps, version strings

**Data Types Supported**: boolean, date, decimal, integer, string, timestamp

### Shell Actions
Shell actions use `subprocess_shell` instead of `subprocess_exec` to enable:
- **Glob pattern expansion**: `.github/workflows/*.yml` expands to actual files
- **Environment variable expansion**: `$HOME`, `$PATH`, etc.
- **Command chaining**: Pipes, redirects, and shell operators
- **Template support**: Jinja2 templating with workflow context

### Git Operations
- **add_files()**: Uses `git add --all` (no file list parameter)
- **Cloning**: Supports depth, branch, and SSH/HTTPS clone types
- **Commits**: Handled by Committer class (AI-powered or manual)
- **Branch Management**: Create, checkout, delete remote branches
