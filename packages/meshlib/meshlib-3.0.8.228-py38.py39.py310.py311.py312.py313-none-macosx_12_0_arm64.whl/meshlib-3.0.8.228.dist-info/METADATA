        from  seeking  injunctive  relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. The prevailing party 
        in any litigation is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs from the other party.
        
        
        OTHER TERMS.
        
        Entire Agreement and Changes. This agreement constitutes the entire 
        agreement between the parties and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous 
        negotiations or agreements, whether oral or written, related to this subject matter. 
        User is not relying on any representation concerning this subject matter, oral or 
        written, not included in this agreement. No representation, promise, or inducement 
        not included in this agreement is binding. No modification or waiver of any term of 
        this agreement is effective unless both parties sign it.
        
        No Assignment. Neither party may assign or transfer this agreement to a third 
        party, nor delegate any duty, except that the agreement may be assigned, without 
        the consent of the other party, (i) as part of a merger or sale of all or substantially 
        all a party's businesses or assets, of User, and (ii) in the case of AMV at any time 
        to any third party.
        
        Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors with respect 
        to each other, and neither party is an agent, employee, or partner of the other 
        party or the other party's affiliates.
        
        Enforceability and Force Majeure. If any term of this agreement is invalid or 
        unenforceable, the other terms remain in effect. Neither party is liable for its non-

        Software provided in connection with this agreement are “commercial items,” 
        “commercial computer software,” or “commercial computer software 
        documentation.” Consistent with DFAR §227.7202 and FAR §12.212, any use, 
        modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, disclosure, or 
        distribution by or for the United States government is governed solely by the 
        terms of this agreement and is prohibited except to the extent permitted by the 
        terms of this agreement.
        
        Open Source Software Licenses. The Software may contain embedded open source 
        software components, which are provided as part of the Software and for 
        which additional terms may be included in the technical documentation.
