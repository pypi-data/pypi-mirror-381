# Placeholder for Memory Encryption
# Memory encryption aims to protect data in RAM from cold boot attacks or direct memory access (DMA) attacks.
# This typically involves hardware-assisted encryption (e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV) or operating system level
# memory protection. Implementing this purely in Python is not feasible as it requires low-level system access.
# However, we can simulate secure memory handling by zeroizing sensitive data after use.
