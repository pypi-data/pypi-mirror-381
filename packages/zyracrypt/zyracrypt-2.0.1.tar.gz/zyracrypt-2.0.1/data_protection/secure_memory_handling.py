    # Note: True secure memory handling (e.g., preventing swap, ensuring immediate zeroization on deallocation)
    # is typically a low-level operating system or hardware feature and cannot be fully guaranteed in pure Python.
    # This method provides a best-effort approach for mutable byte arrays.
