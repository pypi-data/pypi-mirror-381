# Pre-Release Cleanup Summary

## Task 1: Legacy Files Organization ✅

### Files Moved to OLD_VERSION/
- `worklog.py` - Final monolithic version (72,999 lines)
- `worklog_original.py` - Earlier version backup
- `worklog_argparse_backup.py` - Argparse-based version
- `simple_test.py` - Old test file
- `test_refactoring.py` - Old test file
- `test_worklog.py` - Old test file
- `test_worklog_simplified.py` - Old test file

### Files Kept in Root
- `test_worklog_updated.py` - Updated test file for new package structure
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `README.md` - Main documentation
- `ToDo.md` - Development roadmap
- `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` - Refactoring documentation
- `setup_drudge_alias.sh` - New alias setup script (created)

### New Alias Setup
Created `setup_drudge_alias.sh` which:
- Detects user's shell (zsh/bash)
- Removes old `worklog` alias if exists
- Adds new `drudge` alias pointing to `python3 -m src.worklog`
- Keeps legacy `worklog` alias for backward compatibility
- Provides usage instructions

**To set up the alias:**
```bash
./setup_drudge_alias.sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Usage:**
```bash
drudge start "My Task"
drudge status
drudge --help
```

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Set up the alias:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/WorkLog
   ./setup_drudge_alias.sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Start using Drudge CLI:**

   drudge end "My First Task"
   drudge daily
   ```

3. **Old files are preserved:**
   - Check `OLD_VERSION/README.md` for details
   - All legacy code is safely archived
   - Can reference old implementation if needed
