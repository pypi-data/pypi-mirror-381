# Feature Specification: Structure Command Subtree Display

**Feature Branch**: `006-structure-command-subtree`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Structure command subtree display: Let's extend the `structure` CLI command to accept an optional Node ID, which would then only display the subtree of the identified node and its descendants."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What format should Node IDs follow for the structure command? ‚Üí A: UUID format (e.g., 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000)
- Q: What's the acceptable response time for rendering large subtrees (1000+ nodes)? ‚Üí A: No specific requirement (best effort)
- Q: Are cyclic references possible in the node tree structure? ‚Üí A: No - tree structure enforces acyclic hierarchy

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user navigating a large document tree, I want to view only the subtree starting from a specific node ID, so that I can focus on a particular section of the hierarchy without visual clutter from unrelated nodes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a document tree with multiple nodes, **When** the user runs the structure command with a valid Node ID parameter, **Then** the system displays only that node and all its descendants in the tree structure.

2. **Given** a document tree exists, **When** the user runs the structure command without a Node ID parameter, **Then** the system displays the entire tree structure as before (backward compatibility).

3. **Given** the user specifies a Node ID, **When** that Node ID doesn't exist in the tree, **Then** the system displays an appropriate error message indicating the node was not found.

4. **Given** a Node ID that exists but has no children, **When** the user requests its subtree, **Then** the system displays only that single node.

5. **Given** a deeply nested node is specified, **When** displaying its subtree, **Then** the indentation and formatting should be consistent with the full tree display format.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an invalid Node ID format is provided? System should display a clear error message indicating the UUID format is required.
- How does system handle when the specified Node ID is the root node? Should display the entire tree (equivalent to no Node ID parameter).
- What happens when the tree is empty? Should display an appropriate message regardless of Node ID parameter.
- How does the system handle cyclic references? Not applicable - tree structure enforces acyclic hierarchy.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept an optional Node ID parameter for the structure command
- **FR-002**: System MUST display only the specified node and all its descendants when a Node ID is provided
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain the existing behavior (display full tree) when no Node ID parameter is provided
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that the provided Node ID exists in the tree
- **FR-005**: System MUST display an error message when a non-existent Node ID is provided
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve the existing tree formatting and indentation style for subtree display
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle Node IDs in UUID format (e.g., 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000)
- **FR-008**: Error messages MUST clearly indicate whether the issue is with the Node ID format or existence
- **FR-009**: System MUST complete subtree rendering with best-effort performance (no specific time requirement)
- **FR-010**: The subtree display MUST show the relationship hierarchy using the same visual indicators as the full tree display

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Node**: A document or container element in the tree structure with a unique identifier and possible child nodes
- **Node ID**: The unique identifier for each node in the tree using UUID format
- **Tree Structure**: The hierarchical organization of nodes with parent-child relationships (acyclic)
- **Subtree**: A node and all of its descendants forming a self-contained portion of the larger tree
