# Feature Specification: Optional Node ID for Compile Command

**Feature Branch**: `008-default-compile-all`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "default compile all nodes: Let's make the node ID argument optional to the `compile` command. If no node ID is provided, then it should select all the root nodes in the binder."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature request is clear: make node_id optional for compile command
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: CLI users compiling content
   ‚Üí Actions: compile without specifying node ID, select all root nodes
   ‚Üí Data: binder structure, root nodes, compiled output
   ‚Üí Constraints: must compile all root nodes when no ID provided
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All major ambiguities resolved through clarification session
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User scenarios defined below
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Requirements are testable and defined below
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Entities identified below
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Prosemark user working on a project with multiple independent document sections, I want to compile all my content at once without having to specify each root node individually, so that I can quickly generate a complete export of my entire project hierarchy.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a binder with 3 root nodes (each representing a separate document section), **When** I run the compile command without providing a node ID, **Then** the system compiles all 3 root nodes and their subtrees into a single concatenated output with double-newline separators between each root's compilation
2. **Given** a binder with no materialized root nodes (empty project or only placeholders), **When** I run the compile command without providing a node ID, **Then** the system produces empty output and exits successfully (no error)
3. **Given** a binder with 2 root nodes and I provide a specific node ID, **When** I run the compile command with that node ID, **Then** the system compiles only that specific node and its subtree (existing behavior preserved)
4. **Given** a binder with root nodes containing empty content, **When** I run the compile command without a node ID, **Then** empty nodes are handled according to the --include-empty flag (excluded by default, included when flag is set)

### Edge Cases
- When the binder contains only placeholder root items (no materialized nodes), system produces empty output and exits successfully
- How does the system handle very large binders with many root nodes (performance considerations)?
- What happens if a root node exists in the binder but its corresponding file is missing? (existing compile behavior applies - skips missing files)
- Root nodes must be processed in binder order (as they appear top-to-bottom in the roots list)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow the compile command to be invoked without a node ID argument
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify all root nodes in the binder when no node ID is provided
- **FR-003**: System MUST compile each root node and its entire subtree when compiling all roots
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve the existing behavior when a specific node ID is provided
- **FR-005**: System MUST concatenate all root node compilations into a single output stream, separated by double newlines (same format as child nodes within a subtree)
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle empty binders (no materialized root nodes) by producing empty output with statistics showing 0 nodes compiled (exit successfully)
- **FR-007**: System MUST skip placeholder root items (items with no node_id) when compiling all roots
- **FR-008**: System MUST apply the --include-empty flag behavior consistently to all root nodes (same behavior as single-node compilation)
- **FR-009**: System MUST report combined statistics across all compiled roots (total node count, total nodes processed, skipped empty count) in the same format as single-node compilation
- **FR-010**: System MUST process root nodes in binder order (top to bottom as they appear in the roots list)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Root Node**: A BinderItem in the binder hierarchy that has no parent (is_root() returns true). May or may not be materialized (have a node_id).
- **Binder**: The hierarchical structure containing all document organization information, with a collection of root-level items
- **Compile Request**: The request to compile content, which now has an optional node_id field instead of required
- **Compile Result**: The output of compilation, containing concatenated content and statistics about the compilation process

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01

- Q: How should multiple root nodes be concatenated in the output? ‚Üí A: Concatenate with double newlines only (same as child nodes, no visual distinction between roots)
- Q: In what order should root nodes be processed when compiling all roots? ‚Üí A: Binder order (top to bottom as they appear in the binder hierarchy)
- Q: How should the --include-empty flag behavior apply when compiling all roots? ‚Üí A: Honor the existing --include-empty flag for all roots (consistent with single-node compilation)
- Q: What should happen when the binder has no materialized root nodes? ‚Üí A: Produce empty output with statistics showing 0 nodes compiled (silent success)
- Q: How should compilation statistics be reported when compiling all roots? ‚Üí A: Combined statistics only (total nodes across all roots, matching single-node format)
