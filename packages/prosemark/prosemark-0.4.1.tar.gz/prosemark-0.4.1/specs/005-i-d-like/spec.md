# Feature Specification: Preserve Extraneous Text in Binder Operations

**Feature Branch**: `005-i-d-like`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I'd like all binder operations to ignore and preserve extraneous text in the binder outline. Here's an example: [example binder structure with narrative text]"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: binder operations, extraneous text preservation, outline structure
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: users managing binder content
   ‚Üí Actions: binder operations (compile, structure, manipulation)
   ‚Üí Data: binder outlines with mixed content (structural + narrative)
   ‚Üí Constraints: preserve all non-structural text unchanged
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific binder operations are affected?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What defines "extraneous text" vs structural elements?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: manage binder with mixed content
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Focus on preservation behavior
6. Identify Key Entities (binder outline, structural elements, extraneous text)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec has clarification needs but core concept is clear
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: Which specific binder operations should preserve extraneous text? ‚Üí A: All binder operations (compile, add, remove, restructure, etc.)
- Q: How should the system identify what constitutes "extraneous text" versus structural elements? ‚Üí A: Any text outside of Markdown list or `<UUID7>.md` link markup
- Q: Should extraneous text formatting (like bold, italic, headers) be preserved exactly as-is during operations? ‚Üí A: Yes, preserve all formatting exactly
- Q: What should happen when a binder operation encounters malformed structural syntax (incomplete lists, broken UUID links)? ‚Üí A: Treat malformed syntax as extraneous, preserve it, and continue processing
- Q: What level of validation should be performed on UUID7 links during binder operations? ‚Üí A: Validate UUID7 format only (36-character UUID)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users work with binder outlines that contain both structural elements (links to files) and narrative/descriptive text. When performing binder operations, users need the system to preserve all extraneous text exactly as written while only modifying the structural hierarchy elements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a binder outline with narrative text like "Act I Director Kolteo Ais, master of the Empire's fleets..." **When** performing a binder operation **Then** the narrative text remains unchanged and in the same position
2. **Given** a binder with section descriptions like "Everyday world, everyday conflict" mixed with structural links **When** restructuring the binder **Then** all descriptive text is preserved in its original location
3. **Given** a complex binder with multiple levels of narrative content **When** adding or removing structural elements **Then** no extraneous text is lost or modified

### Edge Cases
- What happens when extraneous text appears between structural elements at different hierarchy levels?
- How does the system distinguish between structural markup and narrative content that uses similar formatting?
- What occurs when extraneous text contains characters or formatting that could be confused with structural syntax?
- When malformed structural syntax is encountered (incomplete lists, broken UUID links), treat it as extraneous text and preserve it while continuing to process valid structural elements

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST preserve all non-structural text content during binder operations unchanged
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain the exact positioning of extraneous text relative to structural elements
- **FR-003**: System MUST distinguish between structural elements (file links, hierarchy markers) and narrative content
- **FR-004**: Binder operations MUST only modify structural hierarchy while leaving all other text intact
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all extraneous text formatting (bold, italic, headers, etc.) exactly as-is without any alteration
- **FR-006**: System MUST support all binder operations (compile, add, remove, restructure, etc.) while preserving extraneous text
- **FR-007**: System MUST treat any text outside of Markdown list items or `<UUID7>.md` link markup as extraneous text to be preserved unchanged
- **FR-008**: System MUST treat malformed structural syntax (incomplete lists, broken UUID links) as extraneous text and preserve it while continuing to process valid structural elements
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate UUID7 format (36-character UUID) to identify structural links, treating non-UUID7 `<*.md>` patterns as extraneous text

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Binder Outline**: Container document with mixed structural and narrative content
- **Structural Elements**: Markdown list items (`-`, `*`) and valid UUID7 file links (`<36-character-UUID>.md`) that define binder organization
- **Extraneous Text**: Any text outside of Markdown list items or valid UUID7 link markup, including narrative descriptions, prose, formatting, commentary, and non-UUID7 `<*.md>` patterns that should be preserved unchanged
- **Binder Operation**: Any system action that modifies or processes binder content
