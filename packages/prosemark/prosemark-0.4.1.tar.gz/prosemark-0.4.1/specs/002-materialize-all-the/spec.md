# Feature Specification: Materialize All Command Option

**Feature Branch**: `002-materialize-all-the`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Materialize all: the `pmk materialize` command needs an `--all` option that will materialize all placeholders in the binder."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature clear: Add --all option to pmk materialize command
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actor: CLI user, Action: materialize placeholders, Data: binder placeholders, Constraint: all at once
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens if some placeholders fail to materialize?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be confirmation prompt before materializing all?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should progress be displayed for bulk operation?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: user runs command with --all flag
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focuses on command behavior and user interaction
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Placeholders, binder, materialization results
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding error handling and user feedback"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer working with PMK needs to materialize multiple placeholders in their binder. Instead of running `pmk materialize` for each placeholder individually, they want to materialize all placeholders at once using a single command with an `--all` flag.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a binder contains multiple unmaterialized placeholders, **When** user runs `pmk materialize --all`, **Then** all placeholders in the binder are materialized
2. **Given** a binder with no placeholders, **When** user runs `pmk materialize --all`, **Then** command completes successfully with appropriate message indicating no placeholders found
3. **Given** some placeholders exist and are already materialized, **When** user runs `pmk materialize --all`, **Then** only unmaterialized placeholders are processed
4. **Given** user runs `pmk materialize --all` in directory without a binder, **When** command executes, **Then** appropriate error message is displayed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: some placeholders fail to materialize while others succeed]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: very large number of placeholders that might take significant time]?
- What occurs when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user interrupts the command mid-execution]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an `--all` option for the `pmk materialize` command
- **FR-002**: System MUST materialize all unmaterialized placeholders in the current binder when `--all` flag is used
- **FR-003**: System MUST display progress or status information during bulk materialization
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle the case where no placeholders exist in the binder
- **FR-005**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: define behavior when some materializations fail - continue, stop, or partial completion?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear feedback about the results of the bulk operation
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to distinguish between individual materialize command and bulk materialize command usage
- **FR-008**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: require confirmation before materializing all, or execute immediately?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Placeholder**: Unmaterialized content within the binder that can be converted to actual content
- **Binder**: Container holding placeholders and materialized content
- **Materialization Result**: Outcome of converting placeholder to actual content, including success/failure status
