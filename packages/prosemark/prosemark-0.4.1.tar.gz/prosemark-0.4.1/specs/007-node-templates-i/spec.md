# Feature Specification: Node Templates

**Feature Branch**: `007-node-templates-i`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "node templates: I'd like to be able to define node templates in `./templates` and use them w/ the `add` command. We should be able to create trees of nodes from a template (directory with node templates inside of it)"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: When a template contains placeholder content, how should the system handle these during node creation? ‚Üí A: Replace interactively - prompt user for each placeholder value
- Q: When the system encounters an invalid template (malformed structure, missing required fields, or syntax errors), what should be the behavior? ‚Üí A: Halt execution - stop immediately with error message
- Q: What format should template files use for their content structure? ‚Üí A: Prosemark format - existing prosemark node format with all features
- Q: How should users list available templates? ‚Üí A: Flag on add command - `pmk add --list-templates`
- Q: What naming conventions and file extension requirements should templates follow? ‚Üí A: .md extension required - all templates must be .md files

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a knowledge worker, I want to create predefined node structures from templates so that I can quickly scaffold common patterns without manually creating each node and relationship.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a template directory `./templates/project-setup/` containing multiple template files, **When** I run `pmk add --template project-setup`, **Then** the system creates all nodes from the template structure in my knowledge base
2. **Given** I have a single template file `./templates/meeting-notes.md`, **When** I run `pmk add --template meeting-notes`, **Then** the system creates a new node based on that template with pre-filled content structure
3. **Given** I want to see available templates, **When** I run `pmk add --list-templates`, **Then** the system displays all available templates from the `./templates` directory
4. **Given** a template contains placeholder content, **When** I create a node from that template, **Then** the system prompts the user interactively for each placeholder value

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the `./templates` directory doesn't exist?
- How does the system handle template name conflicts or duplicate template names?
- What happens when a template references files that don't exist?
- How does the system handle templates with invalid node content or malformed structure?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST recognize and use a `./templates` directory for storing node templates
- **FR-002**: System MUST extend the `add` command to accept a `--template` parameter for specifying template names
- **FR-003**: System MUST be able to create individual nodes from single template files
- **FR-004**: System MUST be able to create node trees from template directories containing multiple template files
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a `--list-templates` flag on the `add` command to display all available templates from the `./templates` directory
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle template directory structures and preserve relationships between template files when creating node trees
- **FR-007**: System MUST halt execution immediately with a clear error message when encountering invalid templates (malformed structure, missing required fields, or syntax errors)
- **FR-008**: Templates MUST use the existing prosemark node format with all its features (markdown content with YAML frontmatter, node relationships, etc.)
- **FR-009**: System MUST require all template files to use the `.md` file extension

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Template**: A predefined node structure or content pattern stored in the `./templates` directory as a `.md` file using prosemark format, can be either a single file or part of a directory structure
- **Template Directory**: A collection of related templates organized as a directory structure that creates multiple interconnected nodes
- **Node Tree**: The resulting structure of multiple nodes created from a template directory, preserving the hierarchical relationships defined in the template
