# Feature Specification: Compile Binder Subtree

**Feature Branch**: `004-compile-binder-subtree`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Compile binder subtree: We need a `compile` command that takes a node ID and concatenates the contents of that node and the contents of all nodes in its subtree."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: How should nodes be ordered when compiling the subtree content? ‚Üí A: Depth-first pre-order
- Q: What format should the compiled content be returned in? ‚Üí A: Plain text
- Q: How should the system handle nodes that have no content (empty nodes)? ‚Üí A: Skip empty nodes entirely
- Q: When concatenating node contents, how should line breaks and spacing be handled between nodes? ‚Üí A: Add double newline (blank line) between nodes
- Q: Does the system have access controls or permissions on nodes? ‚Üí A: No access controls - all nodes are accessible

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user organizing information in a hierarchical node structure (binder), I need to compile and export all content from a specific node and its descendants into a single concatenated output. This allows me to generate complete documents or sections from my organized notes and content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a node with child nodes containing text content, **When** they run the compile command with that node's ID, **Then** the system outputs the concatenated content of the parent node followed by all descendant nodes' content
2. **Given** a user provides a valid node ID, **When** they execute the compile command, **Then** the output includes content from all nodes in the subtree in depth-first pre-order traversal (parent node content appears before its children's content)
3. **Given** a user has a node with no children, **When** they compile that node, **Then** only that node's content is returned
4. **Given** a user provides an invalid or non-existent node ID, **When** they attempt to compile, **Then** the system provides a clear error message indicating the node was not found

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a node in the subtree has no content (empty node)? ‚Üí System skips empty nodes entirely with no output
- How does system handle circular references if they exist in the node structure?
- What happens when the user lacks permission to access certain nodes in the subtree? ‚Üí Not applicable - no access controls exist on nodes
- How does the system handle very large subtrees that might produce enormous output? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should there be size limits or pagination?]
- What happens if nodes contain different content types? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: are nodes text-only or can they contain other data types?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a node identifier as input to the compile command
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve the content of the specified node
- **FR-003**: System MUST traverse and retrieve content from all descendant nodes in the subtree
- **FR-004**: System MUST concatenate all retrieved content into a single output
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve original formatting within each node's content and add double newline (blank line) between concatenated nodes
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that the provided node ID exists before attempting compilation
- **FR-007**: System MUST skip empty nodes entirely (no output for nodes with no content)
- **FR-008**: The compile output MUST NOT include node metadata (no titles, IDs, or separators - content only)
- **FR-009**: System MUST return the compiled content as plain text (concatenated content only, no additional formatting or metadata)
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle the traversal order using depth-first pre-order traversal (process parent node before its children)
- **FR-011**: System MUST be able to access all nodes without permission checks (no access control restrictions)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Node**: Represents a unit of content in the hierarchical structure, containing text/content and potentially child nodes
- **Subtree**: The collection of a node and all its descendants in the hierarchy
- **Compiled Output**: The concatenated result of combining content from multiple nodes
