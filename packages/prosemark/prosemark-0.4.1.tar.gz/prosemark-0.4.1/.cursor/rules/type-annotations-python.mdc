title: Type annotations in Python code
description: When writing or editing Python code (`*.py`), ALWAYS use type annotations for functions and methods.
---

- All new Python code must include type annotations.
- Include the following import at the top of all Python files:
  ```python
  from __future__ import annotations
  ```
- Annotate all function and method parameters and return values.
- Annotate class variables and complex data structures.
- Define a TypedDict for complex dictionary structures with known structures.
