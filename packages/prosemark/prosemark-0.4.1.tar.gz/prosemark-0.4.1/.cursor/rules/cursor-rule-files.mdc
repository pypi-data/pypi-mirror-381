title: Cursor rule files for conventions
description: When adding a new convention to CONVENTIONS.md, always create a corresponding Cursor rule file in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.
---

- Name the file with a kebab-case version of the convention title with `.mdc` extension.
  - Example: For "Python PEP-8 code style" convention, create `.cursor/rules/python-pep8-code-style.mdc`
- Include YAML frontmatter at the top of the file with:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: [Convention Title]
  description: [First line of the convention section]
  ---
  ```
- Copy the content of the convention section (bullet points and examples) after the frontmatter.
- Ensure the file uses the same formatting as the original convention in CONVENTIONS.md.
