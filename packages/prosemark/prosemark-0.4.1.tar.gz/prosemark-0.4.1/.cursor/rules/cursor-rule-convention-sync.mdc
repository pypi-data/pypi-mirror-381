title: Synchronizing Cursor rules with conventions
description: When adding a new Cursor rule file (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`), always add a corresponding section to CONVENTIONS.md.
---

- Create a second-level heading in CONVENTIONS.md with the same title as the Cursor rule.
- Copy the description from the Cursor rule's frontmatter as the first line of the section.
- Include all content from the Cursor rule file in the CONVENTIONS.md section.
- Maintain consistent formatting between the Cursor rule file and CONVENTIONS.md.
- Ensure any examples in the Cursor rule are also included in the CONVENTIONS.md section.
