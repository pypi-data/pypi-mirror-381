Dependencies
============

The development relies on several packages:

- Mandatory: |DEPENDENCIES_MANDATORY|
- Optional:  |DEPENDENCIES_OPTIONAL|

The mandatory dependencies, if any, are installed automatically by `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`_, if they are not already, as part of the installation of |PROJECT_NAME|.
Python distribution platforms or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) should also take care of this.
The optional dependencies, if any, must be installed independently by following the related instructions, for added functionalities of |PROJECT_NAME|.
