# Suitesparse, as installed with Debian, is thread-parallel using OpenMP.
# OpenMP silently assumes, it can spawn as many threads as there are cores.
# In a worst case scenario, this leads to a number of threads quadratic in
# the core count, if you also do parallel test execution with the maximum
# number of cores. We solve the issue by disallowing OpenMP to allocate more
# than one thread.
