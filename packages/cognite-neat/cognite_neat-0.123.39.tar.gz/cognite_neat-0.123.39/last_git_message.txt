Improve raw extractor (#1302)

# Description

Previously RAW extractor was not converting string content of keys to
ideal type, this was only done for nested values (if value was dict).
Furthermore, if key (e.g., `asset`) was holding connection (`Asset001`),
we were creating two triples:

```
ns:instance_001 ns:asset ns:Asset001 .
ns:instance_001 ns:asset Asset001'^^xsd:string .
```

which downstream when we are doing data model inference we would get
that property `asset` is of multi value type (`string`, `connection`)

In this PR these issues are now fixed, i.e. conversion to the ideal type
is done for any string value, while if key hold connection only triple
representing it is created (and not one holding data)

## Bump

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## Changelog
### Improved

- Improved RAW extractor to convert all string values (not just nested)
to their ideal types and to generate only a single triple for
connection-type keys, eliminating redundant string-typed triples that
previously caused incorrect multi-type inferences.
