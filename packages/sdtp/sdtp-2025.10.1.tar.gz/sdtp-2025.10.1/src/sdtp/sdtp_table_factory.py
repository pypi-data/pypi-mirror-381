'''
An SDMLTableFactory class and associated utilities.  The SDMLTableFactory builds
an SDMLTable of the appropriate type.  Each Table type has an associated Factory
class, and the factory class which builds the table  is registered with the
TABLE_REGISTRY.
Each SDMLFactory class has a single class method, 
build_table(table_spec, *args, **kwargs)
table_spec is a dictionary which must have two fields, type and schema

    '''
    A class which builds an SDMLTable of a specific type.  All SDMLTables have a schema, but after
    that the specification varies, depending on the method the table uses to get the table rows.
    Specific factories should subclass this and instantiate the class method build_table.
    The tag is the table type, simply a string which indicates which class of table should be
    built.
    A new SDMLTableFactory class should be built for each concrete subclass of SDMLTable, and ideally
    in the same file.  The SDMLTable subclass should put a "type" field in the intermediate form,
    and the value of "type" should be the type built by the SDTP Table field
    SDMLTableFactory is an abstract class -- each concrete subclass should call the init method on the 
    table_type on initialization.  build_table is the method which actually builds the table; the superclass 
    convenience version of the method throws an InvalidDataException if the spec has the wrong table type 
    Every subclass should set the table_type.  This attribute 
    registers the tables  which this Factory builds
