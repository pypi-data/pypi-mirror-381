# print

The `print` tool allows you to output information about game state, entities, and other objects to stdout. This is essential for debugging, monitoring game state, and verifying operations.

## Basic Usage

```python
print(*args) -> str
```

Returns a string representation of the printed message.

### Parameters

- `*args`: Variable number of objects to print

### Supported Types

- Entity objects
- Inventory objects
- Dictionaries
- Booleans
- Strings
- Position objects
- Lists
- Tuples
- Any object with a `dict()` method (BaseModel derivatives)

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Entity Information

```python
# Print entity details
drill = place_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, position=pos)
print(f"Put a burner mining drill at {drill.position}")  # Shows position, direction, status, etc.

# Print multiple entities
furnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=pos)
print(f"Put a burner mining drill at {drill.position} and a furnace at {furnace.position}")  # Shows details of both entities
```

### 2. Inventory Monitoring

```python
# Check player inventory
inventory = inspect_inventory()
print(f"Inventory: {inventory}")  # Shows all items and quantities

# Check entity inventory
chest = place_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, position=pos)
chest_inventory = inspect_inventory(chest)
print(f"Chest inventory {chest_inventory}")  # Shows chest contents
```

### 3. Position Tracking

```python
# Print positions
resource_pos = nearest(Resource.Coal)
print(f"Coal position {resource_pos}")  # Shows x, y coordinates
```

## Best Practices

1. **Operation Verification**

```python
def verify_placement(entity: Entity, pos: Position):
    print(f"Attempting to place {entity} at {pos}")
    try:
        placed = place_entity(entity, position=pos)
        print(f"Successfully placed {placed.name}: {placed}")
        return placed
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Placement failed: {e}")
        return None
```

## Common Patterns

1. **Operation Logging**

```python
def setup_mining_operation():
    # Log each step
    print("Starting mining setup...")

    drill = place_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, position=pos)
    print(f"Placed drill at {drill.position}")

    chest = place_entity_next_to(
        Prototype.WoodenChest,
        drill.drop_position,
        direction=Direction.DOWN
    )
    print(f"Added output chest at {chest.position}")

    print("Mining setup complete")
```

2. **Validation Checks**

```python
def validate_entity(entity: Entity):
    if not entity:
        print("Entity is None")
        return False

    print("Validating entity:", entity)
    if entity.status == EntityStatus.NO_POWER:
        print("Entity has no power")
    elif entity.status == EntityStatus.NO_FUEL:
        print("Entity needs fuel")

    return entity.status == EntityStatus.WORKING
```

Remember to use print statements strategically to track important state changes and verify operations are working as expected, but avoid excessive printing that could clutter the output.
Add alot of details into print statements
