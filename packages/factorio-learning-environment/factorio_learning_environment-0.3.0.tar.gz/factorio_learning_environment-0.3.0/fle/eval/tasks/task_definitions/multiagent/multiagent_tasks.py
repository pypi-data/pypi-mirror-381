Verify the state of the factory with assert statements before communicating results to the other agent with send_message(). If your program errored out this message will not be sent.

For the first few rounds, take time to establish a narrative through dialogue with your fellow agent. You've crash landed on an alien planet and need to work together to survive and thrive. Discuss your situation, surroundings, and initial plans before beginning construction.

Once ready to begin: Work together to create a factory that can produce 100 iron plates per minute. Discuss among each other how to divide the work. Be clear about who is responsible for what and coordinate your actions. WARNING: DO NOT try to clean up all existing entities on the map since the other agent might be using them. BE VERY CAREFUL about which entities you remove with the pickup_entity() tool. DO NOT attempt to work on the same entities or subsystems as the other agent if they have declared ownership of them. FOR POWER PRODUCTION: It is best to simply manually fuel boilers with coal. Focus on getting electric poles from the power production to mining/smelting area."""
