To achieve this objective we first need to mine all the raw resources and craft everything as we don't have any resources in the inventory.
We need to mine enough iron ore for the plates and gear wheels, mine enough stone for the furnaces, and enough coal for the furnaces.
In total for crafting one burner mining drill we need to 3 iron gear wheel (2 iron plates each), 3 iron plates and one stone furnace. This means we need atleast 9 iron plates. Therefore we need to mine atleast 9 iron ore, 5 coal and as we need 2 stone furnaces, one for the burner mining drill recipe and one for smelting ores, we need 2\*5 = 10 stone.
Taking into account the buffer we will mine atleast 20 iron ore, 10 coal and 15 stone
Then we need to smelt iron plates from the ore. For that we need to put down a stone furnace, insert coal and iron ore and wait until all plates have been smelt.
After that we can can craft out burner mining drill
