To achieve this objective we need to get crafting materials for the electric mining drill. We need 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels and 10 iron plates. To craft the gear wheels, we will need 10 iron plates. To craft the circuits we will need 3 iron plates. In total then we will need 23 iron plates but we only have 20.
Therefore first we need to mine some additional iron ore to turn into iron plates. We should mine 10 more iron ore to ensure we have all the required resources.
Then we need to smelt iron plates from the ore. For that we need to put down a stone furnace that we have in our inventory, insert coal and iron ore and wait until all plates have been smelt.
After that we can can craft the electric mining drill
