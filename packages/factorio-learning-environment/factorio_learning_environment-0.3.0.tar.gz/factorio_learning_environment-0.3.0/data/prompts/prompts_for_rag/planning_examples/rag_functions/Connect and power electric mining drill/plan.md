To achieve this objective we need to have a offshore pump, boiler, steam engine and the electric mining drill. We laso need pipes and electic power pokles for connections. We have all of them in our inventory
Therefore first we need to mine place the offshore pump on a water source. Then we need to place the boiler next to the water pump and a steam engine next to the boiler. Then we need to connect all of them with pipes
We then need to check if the steam engine is receiving electricity.
if it is, we finally need to place the mining drill onto a copper patch and connect the drill with the steam engine with the electric poles
