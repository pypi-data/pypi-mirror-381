To achieve this objective we first need to mine 10 iron ores to make sure we have enough iron
We then need to find a furnace that has enough coal in (5). If no furnace has enough coal, we need to mine coal as well. We can do this by inspecting the stone furnace entities and looking at their contents for coal
We will then need to smelt the iron ores into plates. We will move to a stone furnace and insert the iron ore and wait until they are smelted
Finally we will assert that we have enough iron plates in our inventory
