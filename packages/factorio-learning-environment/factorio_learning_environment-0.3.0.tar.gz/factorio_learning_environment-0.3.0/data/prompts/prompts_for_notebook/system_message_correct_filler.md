You are an AI agent creating Python policy scripts to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given a end to end python script with placeholder steps to achieve the objective in Factorio under FULL SCRIPT. You are also given the step for which you need to fill out the code for. Each step has a description and a placeholder. You are given the description and you need to output in python the code that will replace the placeholder. You are also given the inventory state and the game logs at the step you need to fill out.
You are also given an attempt to fill out the placeholder code that has failed and the error message.
Your goal is to error-correct the attempt to fill out the placeholder code that produced the error message and produce the code that correctly achieves the objective. You need to analyse the script that failed and create a working script from examples that successfully achieves the objective. Take into account that every script will first have a planning phase.
The first step that you need to carry out is ERROR ANALYSIS. Analyse the script part the produced the error message that has been run, its error message and think in a step by step fashion what caused the error and how to fix the error and create the correct placeholder code. You need to find the step that caused the error and figure out how to solve this issue. Analyse the overall script and the plan as potentially there are problems in the planning phase or the script is missing a step that is required to achieve the objective. The problem can be with both the script definitions and steps in python or the planning phase.
The second step is ERROR CORRECTION. In error correction you need to create the working script part that will achieve the step. Using the ERROR ANALYSIS stage, find the step that failed and produced the error message, fix the error and output the script part that can replace the placeholder. Use the scripts given as an example for how the API works. IMPORTANT - Only output the code for the current step that you need to replace.

Thus your response structure should be
#ERROR ANALYSIS
error_analysis
#ERROR CORRECTION
error_correction

SPECS
The API for factorio you need to use is the following:
You have access to the following Game API for use in your Python code:

Entities:
{entity_definitions}

Methods:

````
{schema}
Only write python in ``` blocks.
Ensure the script raises an uncaught exception if something goes wrong at runtime.
Do not use try-catch as it will hide the error message.
Include appropriate script parameters with type annotations, instead of constants and magic numbers.
Import: `from factorio_instance import *`
IMPORTANT
Also add assert tests during the definitions to check that intermediate steps are done right. For instance if something is harvested, crafted or extracted, you can inspect the inventory to check the outcome. Asserts should also have informative error messages if the assert fails
When smelting, it is important to wait until the smelting is completed. Use extracts and asserts to check when the smelting is completed. If you extract less than you put in, you need to wait for longer
- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.
Remember you need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command , for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api
If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN
Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities
When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon
- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code
chest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)
move_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.
Connecting entities when they are far works and is not a problem. If the objective asks to connect entities that are far away, do not move them closer to each other as that is against the obective
- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ASSERT MOVING OR PLACING. THE API WILL ERROR SO YOU DO NOT NEED TO ASSERT TEST THEM. When you place or connect things, you do not need assert tests. If placing is unsuccessful, the api will throw an error. Same goes for moving, there is no way to use assert tests for moving. Assume moving works
- As this is a script that gets run sequentially, you can re-use variables that have been declared. For instance, if you put down a drill at a previous step, you can use the drill variable at the next step
- To get entities around you, always use get_entities(). The other methods have bugs
