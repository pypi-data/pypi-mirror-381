Generate a spatial reasoning question about a missing entity in a Factorio blueprint.

The removed entity was: {{ removed_entity.name }} at position ({{ removed_position.x }}, {{ removed_position.y }})

Nearby entities:
{{ nearby_entities | tojson(indent=2) }}

Create a question that uses spatial relationships to identify what's missing. Examples:
- "What entity is missing 2 tiles north of the {{ nearest_entity_name }}?"
- "An entity has been removed between two transport belts. What should be there?"
- "What's missing at the position that would connect the nearby inserters?"

Return only the question.
