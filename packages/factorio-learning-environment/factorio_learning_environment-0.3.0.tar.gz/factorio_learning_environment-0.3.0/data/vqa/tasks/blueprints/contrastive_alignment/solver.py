Generate {num_variations} different variations, each with:
1. A concise title (max 10 words) that describes what this blueprint builds
2. A purpose description (1-2 sentences) explaining what it does and how it's used

Important guidelines:
- Each variation should emphasize different aspects of the blueprint
- Variation 1: Focus on the primary function and most obvious use case
- Variation 2: Highlight efficiency, automation, or technical aspects
- Variation 3: Emphasize scalability, integration, or advanced features
{"- Additional variations: Consider alternative use cases, specialized applications, or unique benefits" if num_variations > 3 else ""}

Make each title and purpose distinct while still being accurate.

Format your response as JSON:
```json
{{
    "variations": [
        {{
            "title": "...",
            "purpose": "..."
