3. Create 3 plausible distractor options that could appear in a Factorio blueprint
4. For entity name questions, use other entity types from the blueprint as distractors when possible

Generate a creative counting question with 4 options. The distractor numbers should be plausible but wrong.

Examples:
- "How many transport-belts are in this blueprint?
   A) 12

GUIDELINES FOR DISTRACTORS:
1. Make them close to the correct answer (within ±50%)
2. Avoid obvious wrong answers like 0 or 1000
3. Include common counting mistakes (off by one, double counting, etc.)

The correct answer should be the option at: {random.choice(["A", "B", "C", "D"])}
