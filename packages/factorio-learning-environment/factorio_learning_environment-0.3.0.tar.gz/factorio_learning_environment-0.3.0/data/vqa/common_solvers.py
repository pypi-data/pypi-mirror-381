Question: 
```
{question}
```
Answer: `{answer}`

Please evaluate if this Q&A pair meets the following criteria:

1. **Specificity**: Is the question specific enough that it has a single, unambiguous answer?
2. **Visual Answerability**: Can the question be answered by looking at a blueprint image?
3. **Clarity**: Is the question clearly worded without confusing terminology?
4. **Answer Match**: Does the provided answer directly and completely answer the question?
5. **Triviality/Tautology**: Is there actual informational content in the question? Or is it self-referential?

Common issues to check for:
- Vague positional references (e.g., "the inserter" when there are multiple)
- Unclear directional terms (using numbers instead of compass directions)
- Ambiguous entity references without specific positions
- Questions that require game knowledge beyond what's visible

If the Q&A pair has issues, provide a revised version that fixes them.

If the question includes multiple choice - it is critical that you keep them!

Return your response in this exact JSON format:
