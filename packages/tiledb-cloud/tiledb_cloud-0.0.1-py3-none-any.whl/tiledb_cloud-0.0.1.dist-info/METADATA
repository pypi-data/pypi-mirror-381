# Do not install this version directly

tiledb-cloud 0.0.1 exists to support tiledb-client 3.0 and should not be
installed except as a dependency of tiledb-client.

The tiledb-client Python package includes both tiledb.client and tiledb.cloud
modules, the latter providing some degree of backwards compatibility. It is
a namespace package, which means that these modules are installed into the same
"tiledb" directory of your environment as the tiledb namespace package.

The legacy tiledb-cloud package on PyPI is also a namespace package, and if
accidentally installed into an environment where tiledb-client was installed,
the deprecated tiledb.cloud module could overwrite the current version.

To help prevent this, tiledb-client depends on this artificially historical
version 0.0.1 of tiledb-cloud.  After installing tiledb-client, you will see
"tiledb-cloud 0.0.1" in the output of `pip list`, and then other versions of
tiledb-cloud will not be fetched as a dependency of any other package, unless
those packages specify an exact version or range of versions.
