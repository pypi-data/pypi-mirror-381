## What is this?

A client library which connects any Python app to a [Metaport](https://gitlab.com/dcentrica/metaport/metaport-server/) server using the [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) SBOM standard for data interchange.

## How to use

### Introduction

The library will automatically generate an SBOM for your app, submit it to Metaport and subsequently delete it. Data can be sent using the `HTTP` or `Email` transports. See [the docs site](https://docs.metaport.sh) for example requests.

The library provides a single executable `metaport` (e.g. `.venv/bin/metaport`). It's designed to be invoked on a schedule via cron from within an application's production environment or as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

This library supports traditional Pip, Poetry, and Pipfile based projects. 

Vulnerabilities will be reported by this agent to your Metaport sserver by invoking the following commands (and in this order):

1. `poetry audit`
2. `pip-audit`

If neither command is available, no vulnerability data will be sent when using `--classic=1`. If however vulnerability data is required, consider running a side-by-side instance of [DependencyTrack](https://dependencytrack.org), and configuring Metaport with it for dependencies and vulnerabilties (without `--classic=1`).

### Requirements

This package requires Python 3.10+. If used as part of a CI/CD setup, it can be installed as a throwaway dependency via Poetry's `--dev` switch ala `poetry add --dev`, or as a permanent dependency of your application.

### Install

1. Poetry

As part of production apps:

```bash
poetry add metaport-agent-python
```

2. Pip

```bash
pip install metaport-agent-python
```

3. Environment Variables

There are some environment variables which need to be set before the lib will operate correctly. Please see [the docs site](https://docs.metaport.sh) for more detailed installation and configuration instructions and examples.
