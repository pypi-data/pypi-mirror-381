"""
Provides result classes that wrap native PyMongo result objects with additional
functionality. These classes include `InsertResult`, `DeleteResult`, `ReplaceResult`, and
`UpdateResult`, each of which corresponds to specific database operations and offers enhanced
access to operation details.

The module ensures compatibility with the `monkey.dao.results` result specifications and adapts
native pymongo result classes for extended use cases and ease of integration. It includes
optional support for bulk operations.
