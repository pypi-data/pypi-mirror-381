Tools for forecasting Lyman-break Galaxies.

## Installation

For regular installation, use PyPI: `pip install lbg_tools`

For dev installation, create a python environment, activate it, then run `bash .setup_dev.sh`.

## Cosmologies

In multiple places you are able to specify a cosmology object for luminosity distance and differential comoving volume calculations.
The default cosmology is Astropy's Planck18, but you can use any Astropy cosmology.
You can also use a CCL cosmology, but to do so you must install CCL yourself.
