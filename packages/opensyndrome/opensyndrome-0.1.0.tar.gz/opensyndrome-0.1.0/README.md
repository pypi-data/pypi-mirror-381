# open-syndrome-python

[![Test](https://github.com/OpenSyndrome/open-syndrome-python/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OpenSyndrome/open-syndrome-python/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Installation

You can install it from PyPI or from Docker.

From PyPi, install the package with `pip install opensyndrome`. Then run it with `osi`.

From Docker, you can run the following command to build the image, tagged `osi`:

```bash
docker build -t osi .
```

Run the container interactively, removing it when it exits

```bash
docker run --rm osi
```

To read a `.env` file, mount it:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/.env:/app/.env:ro" \
  osi
```

To name the container and keep it around:

```bash
docker run --name osi-cli -it osi
```

## Usage

First, download the schema and definitions in order to work with the CLI locally.

```bash
osi download schema
osi download definitions
```

The files will be placed in the folder `.open_syndrome` in `$HOME`.

### Convert a human-readable syndrome definition to a machine-readable JSON

You need to have [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) installed locally
to use this feature. Pull the models you want to use with `osi` before running the command.
We have tested llama3.2, mistral, and deepseek-r1 so far.

Don't go well with structured output: qwen2.5-coder

```bash
osi convert
osi convert --model mistral

# to have the JSON translated to a specific language and edit it just after conversion
osi convert --language "Português do Brasil" --model mistral --edit

# include a validation step after conversion
osi convert --validate
```

### Convert a machine-readable JSON syndrome definition to a human-readable format

```bash
osi humanize <path-to-json-file>
osi humanize <path-to-json-file> --model mistral
osi humanize <path-to-json-file> --model mistral --language "Português do Brasil"
```

### Validate a machine-readable JSON syndrome definition

```bash
osi validate
```

## Development

To get started with development, you need to have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.

### Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### Generate Ollama-compatible JSON

> You only need to do this if you are a maintainer adding a new OSI schema or updating an existing one.

Since Ollama requires a specific, more simple, JSON format, we need to generate an Ollama-compatible schema.
To do this, we use `datamodel-code-generator` to generate a Pydantic schema. Run the following command to update it:

```bash
make ollama_schema
```

It will create a `schema.py` file in the root of the project. Be careful when editing this file manually.
