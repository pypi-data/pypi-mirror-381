        This message is based on a template that you configured in your call to
        create or update a user pool. This template includes your custom sign-up
        instructions and placeholders for user name and temporary password.

        Alternatively, you can call ``AdminCreateUser`` with ``SUPPRESS`` for
        the ``MessageAction`` parameter, and Amazon Cognito won't send any
        email.

        In either case, if the user has a password, they will be in the
        ``FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD`` state until they sign in and set their
        password. Your invitation message template must have the ``{####}``
        password placeholder if your users have passwords. If your template
        doesn't have this placeholder, Amazon Cognito doesn't deliver the
        invitation message. In this case, you must update your message template
        and resend the password with a new ``AdminCreateUser`` request with a
        ``MessageAction`` value of ``RESEND``.

        This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021,
        US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number
        before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS
        text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with
        `Amazon Pinpoint <https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/>`__.
        Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise,
        Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to
        sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

        If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any
        other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service

        mode <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html>`__
        , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test
        your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the
        sandbox and into production. For more information, see `SMS message

        can't use their password to sign in. If the user to deactivate is a
        linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an existing
        user is removed. When the external user signs in again, and the user is
        no longer attached to the previously linked ``DestinationUser``, the
        user must create a new user account.

        The value of ``ProviderName`` must match the name of a user pool IdP.

        To deactivate a local user, set ``ProviderName`` to ``Cognito`` and the
        ``ProviderAttributeName`` to ``Cognito_Subject``. The
        ``ProviderAttributeValue`` must be user's local username.

        The ``ProviderAttributeName`` must always be ``Cognito_Subject`` for
        social IdPs. The ``ProviderAttributeValue`` must always be the exact
        subject that was used when the user was originally linked as a source
        user.

        For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked
        identity has not yet been used to sign in, the ``ProviderAttributeName``
        and ``ProviderAttributeValue`` must be the same values that were used
        for the ``SourceUser`` when the identities were originally linked using
        ``AdminLinkProviderForUser`` call. This is also true if the linking was
        done with ``ProviderAttributeName`` set to ``Cognito_Subject``. If the
        user has already signed in, the ``ProviderAttributeName`` must be
        ``Cognito_Subject`` and ``ProviderAttributeValue`` must be the
        ``NameID`` from their SAML assertion.

        (classic) and ``2`` for managed login. It also updates the SSL
        certificate for user pool custom domains.

        Changes to the domain branding version take up to one minute to take
        effect for a prefix domain and up to five minutes for a custom domain.

        This operation doesn't change the name of your user pool domain. To
        change your domain, delete it with ``DeleteUserPoolDomain`` and create a
        new domain with ``CreateUserPoolDomain``.

        You can pass the ARN of a new Certificate Manager certificate in this
        request. Typically, ACM certificates automatically renew and you user
        pool can continue to use the same ARN. But if you generate a new
        certificate for your custom domain name, replace the original
        configuration with the new ARN in this request.

        ACM certificates for custom domains must be in the US East (N. Virginia)
        Amazon Web Services Region. After you submit your request, Amazon
        Cognito requires up to 1 hour to distribute your new certificate to your
        custom domain.

        For more information about adding a custom domain to your user pool, see
        `Configuring a user pool
        domain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-add-custom-domain.html>`__.

        in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM
        credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the
        corresponding IAM permission in a policy.
