"""Public package interface for ub_grader.

This package exposes a minimal surface intended for student / script usage:

Functions
---------
init_students(students)
    Initialize the inâ€‘memory student registry with iterable entries.
get_student(student_id)
    Retrieve a previously registered student (primarily for internal use).
load_spec(url)
    Load and validate an assignment specification JSON (local path or HTTP).
grade(func, student_id, public_key_path=None, signing_key_path=None,
            output_path=None)
        Execute all tests in the loaded spec against the provided callable
        and emit an encrypted grading report.

Only these names are exported via ``__all__`` to keep the public API small.
