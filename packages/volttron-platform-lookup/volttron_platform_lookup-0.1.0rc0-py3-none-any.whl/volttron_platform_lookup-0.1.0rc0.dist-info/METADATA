# Platform Lookup Service

A FastAPI-based microservice for managing platform registrations and lookups. This service provides a RESTful API for registering and managing platforms with their associated credentials and network addresses.

## Features

- Platform registration and management
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- Input validation using Pydantic models
- Support for platform grouping
- JSON-based persistent storage
- RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

## Installation

1. From pypi
  
   ```bash
   pip install volttron-platform-lookup
   ```

1. From source code:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd platform-lookup
   poetry install
   ```


## Usage

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   volttron-platform-lookup <optional port. defaults to 8000>
   ```

2. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
3. Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## API Endpoints

The service provides RESTful endpoints for platform management. All data is exchanged in JSON format.

### Platform Model

Each platform registration includes:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the platform (alphanumeric, underscores, and hyphens allowed)
- `address`: Network address where the platform can be reached (IP, domain, or URI)
- `public_credentials`: Authentication credential (minimum 16 characters)
- `group`: Optional grouping parameter (defaults to "default")

Example platform registration:

```json
{
    "id": "platform-123",
    "address": "tcp://example.com",
    "public_credentials": "abcdef1234567890",
    "group": "production"
}
```

## Data Storage

Platform data is stored in `platforms.json` with thread-safe access mechanisms to prevent race conditions during concurrent operations.

## Security

- Input validation for all API endpoints
- Credential length requirements
- Address format validation
- Thread-safe operations
