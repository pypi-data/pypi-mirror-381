MCP Services Package

This package contains business logic services that handle data processing and analysis.
Services are responsible for retrieving, processing, and formatting data from the cache.

Services follow SOLID principles:
- Single Responsibility: Each service has one clear purpose
- Open/Closed: Easy to extend with new functionality
- Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
