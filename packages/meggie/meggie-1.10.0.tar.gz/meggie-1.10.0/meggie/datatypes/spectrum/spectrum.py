    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Name of the spectrum, used in the UI lists and in the .exp file.
    directory : str
        Absolute path to the data folder, usually workspace/experiment/subject/spectrums.
    params : dict
        Contains additional information about the spectrum.
    content : dict of np.array, optional
        The spectral content as a numpy array. If not provided,
        is assumed to be saved to file system earlier.
    freqs : np.array, optional
        Frequencies as a array of points in frequency. If not provided,

    info : mne.Info, optional
        The info structure from the raw data. Is stored because contains
