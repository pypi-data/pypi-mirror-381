"""
The message bus system can be used to receive notifications when properties of
Blender data-blocks are changed via the data API.


--------------------

The message bus system is triggered by updates via the RNA system. This means
that the following updates will result in a notification on the message bus:

* Changes via the Python API, for example some_object.location.x += 3

.
* Changes via the sliders, fields, and buttons in the user interface.

The following updates do not trigger message bus notifications:

* Moving objects in the 3D Viewport.
* Changes performed by the animation system.

Changes done from msgbus

 callbacks are not included in related undo steps,
so users can easily skip their effects by using Undo followed by Redo.

Unlike properties update

 callbacks, message bus update callbacks are postponed
until all operators have finished executing.
Additionally, for each property the callback is only triggered once per update cycle,
even if the property was changed multiple times during that period.


--------------------

Below is an example of subscription to changes in the active object's location.

```../examples/bpy.msgbus.1.py```

Some properties are converted to Python objects when you retrieve them. This
needs to be avoided in order to create the subscription, by using
datablock.path_resolve("property_name", False)

:

```../examples/bpy.msgbus.2.py```

It is also possible to create subscriptions on a property of all instances of a
certain type:

```../examples/bpy.msgbus.3.py```

[NOTE]
All subscribers will be cleared on file-load. Subscribers can be re-registered on load,
see bpy.app.handlers.load_post.
