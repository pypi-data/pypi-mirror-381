# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Model

Context MCP is designed with security as a core principle:

### Read-Only Operations

- âœ… **No Write Operations**: The server cannot create, modify, or delete files
- âœ… **No Code Execution**: The server does not execute user code
- âœ… **No Network Operations**: The server does not make external network requests

### Path Security

- âœ… **Path Validation**: All file paths are validated and restricted to `PROJECT_ROOT`
- âœ… **Directory Traversal Protection**: Uses `Path.resolve()` to prevent `../` attacks
- âœ… **Absolute Path Enforcement**: Relative paths are resolved to absolute paths

### File Access Control

- âœ… **Binary File Protection**: Automatically detects and rejects binary files
- âœ… **Permission Respect**: Honors filesystem permissions and returns clear errors
- âœ… **No Privileged Operations**: Runs with the same permissions as the calling process

### Configuration Security

- âœ… **Environment-Based Config**: Sensitive configuration via environment variables
- âœ… **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No credentials or secrets in code
- âœ… **Minimal Permissions**: Requires only read access to configured project

## Known Limitations

### By Design

1. **Read-Only Access**: Cannot modify project files (this is intentional)
2. **Single Project**: Each instance serves one project directory
3. **Local Filesystem Only**: No remote filesystem support
4. **Text Files Only**: Binary files are rejected for safety

### Potential Risks

1. **Information Disclosure**: Can read any text file within `PROJECT_ROOT`
   - **Mitigation**: Carefully configure `PROJECT_ROOT` to exclude sensitive directories
   - **Recommendation**: Do not point `PROJECT_ROOT` to system directories or home directories

2. **Log File Exposure**: Logs may contain file paths and search queries
   - **Mitigation**: Logs are stored locally with 7-day retention
   - **Recommendation**: Review `agent_mcp.log` location and permissions

3. **Search Performance**: Complex searches may consume CPU
   - **Mitigation**: Configurable timeout (default 60 seconds)
   - **Recommendation**: Set appropriate `SEARCH_TIMEOUT` for your environment

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues to:

ðŸ“§ **Email**: context-mcp-security@example.com

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenario
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
4. **Environment**: OS, Python version, Agent MCP version
5. **Proposed Fix**: If you have suggestions (optional)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Restrict PROJECT_ROOT**:
   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "PROJECT_ROOT": "/path/to/specific/project"  // Not "/" or "~"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Review Permissions**:
   - Ensure Claude Desktop runs with minimal necessary permissions
   - Do not run as administrator/root

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Review `agent_mcp.log` periodically
   - Check for unexpected file access patterns

4. **Exclude Sensitive Directories**:
   - Do not include directories with secrets, keys, or credentials
   - Use `.gitignore` patterns as guidance

5. **Update Regularly**:
   - Keep context-mcp updated to latest version
   - Monitor security advisories

### For Developers

1. **Path Validation**:
   - Always use `PathValidator.validate()` before file operations
   - Never bypass security checks

2. **Input Sanitization**:
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use type hints and runtime checks

3. **Error Messages**:
   - Do not expose sensitive paths in error messages
   - Log detailed errors, return sanitized messages to clients

4. **Testing**:
   - Include security tests in all PRs
   - Test path traversal scenarios
   - Test permission boundaries

5. **Dependencies**:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review security advisories for dependencies

## Security Checklist

Before deploying context-mcp:

- [ ] `PROJECT_ROOT` points to a specific project directory
- [ ] `PROJECT_ROOT` does not contain sensitive credentials
- [ ] File permissions properly restrict access
- [ ] Log location is secure and monitored
- [ ] Running with minimal necessary permissions
- [ ] Latest version of context-mcp installed
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Configuration reviewed for security issues

## Disclosure Policy

When a security vulnerability is fixed:

1. **Private Notification**: Reporters are notified privately
2. **Security Advisory**: Published on GitHub Security Advisories
3. **Patch Release**: New version released with fix
4. **Public Disclosure**: After patch is available (typically 7 days)
5. **Credit**: Reporter credited (if desired)
