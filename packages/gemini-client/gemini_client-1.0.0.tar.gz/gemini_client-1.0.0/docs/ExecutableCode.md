# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ExecutableCode from a JSON string
executable_code_instance = ExecutableCode.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(ExecutableCode.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
executable_code_dict = executable_code_instance.to_dict()

executable_code_from_dict = ExecutableCode.from_dict(executable_code_dict)
