# TumorImagingBench

<div align="center">

**A comprehensive framework for evaluating and comparing foundation model feature extractors for radiomics in medical imaging.**

</div>

## 📋 Overview

TumorImagingBench is a robust platform that enables researchers and practitioners to:

* Extract meaningful features from medical images using state-of-the-art foundation models
* Compare performance metrics across diverse radiomics datasets
* Systematically evaluate model stability, robustness, and interpretability 
* Benchmark novel foundation models against established approaches

This framework bridges the gap between advancing foundation models and their practical application in medical imaging analysis.

## 🔍 Key Features

* **Unified Interface**: Common API for all foundation model extractors
* **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Standardized metrics across multiple datasets
* **Interpretability Tools**: Generation of saliency maps and attribution analysis
* **Extensible Architecture**: Easily integrate new models and datasets

## 💻 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AIM-Harvard/TumorImagingBench.git
cd TumorImagingBench

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Feature Extraction

```python
from models import CTClipVitExtractor, FMCIBExtractor

# Initialize a model
model = FMCIBExtractor()
model.load()

# Extract features from a sample
features = model.extract(sample_path)
```

For systematic feature extraction across datasets, we provide dedicated scripts in the `evaluation/` directory. These scripts offer a standardized approach that can be extended to new datasets through our base feature extractor class.

### Model Evaluation

For examples of model evaluation on different datasets, explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/modelling/` directory. These notebooks demonstrate:

* Feature extraction workflows
* Model training and validation
* Performance analysis and comparison
* Visualization of results

## 📈 Analysis Tools

Our repository includes specialized analysis notebooks:

| Notebook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `stability_analysis.ipynb` | Evaluate model stability with various perturbations |
| `robustness_analysis.ipynb` | Assess model robustness to noise and transformations |
| `saliency_analysis.ipynb` | Visualize and analyze model activation maps |
| `overall_analysis.ipynb` | Compare aggregate performance across models and datasets |
