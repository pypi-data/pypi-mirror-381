## Getting started

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Thank you for your interest in OpenBakery. Before we start, we need to ensure that your system has the necessary software installed.

OpenBakery requires **Python version 3.8** (or greater) and **`pip` version 22.0** (or greater).


### Checking Python version

To determine if your system has Python installed and which version, open **Terminal** â€”on macOS and Linuxâ€” or **PowerShell** and **Command Prompt** â€”on Windowsâ€” and run the following command:

    python --version

{: .note }
If the `python` command isn't found, try using `python3` instead.

If you need to install Python (or just a newer version of it) please refer to the instructions provided at [python.org] for your platform.


### Checking `pip` version

To determine if your Python environment has `pip` installed and which version, run this command:

    python -m pip --version

If you need to install `pip` (or just a newer version of it) please refer to the instructions provided at [pip.pypa.io].
