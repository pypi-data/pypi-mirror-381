            Compress files before shuffling them. Compression reduces disk and network
            IO, but disables memory mapping.
            Choose "zstd" for good compression performance.

            File format to use for shuffles.
        shuffle_compression_level
            Compression level of shuffle.
            If set to `None` it is decided by the optimizer.
        sort_partitioned
            Whether group-by and selected aggregations are pre-aggregated

            Must be a URI to an accessible object store location.

            It is recommended to write to a directory path
            for example `"my-location/"`, instead of as single file
            as a single file can only be written from a single
            node.

        compression : {'lz4', 'uncompressed', 'snappy', 'gzip', 'lzo', 'brotli', 'zstd'}
            Choose "zstd" for good compression performance.
            Choose "lz4" for fast compression/decompression.
            Choose "snappy" for more backwards compatibility guarantees
            when you deal with older parquet readers.
        compression_level
            The level of compression to use. Higher compression means smaller files on
            disk.

            - "gzip" : min-level: 0, max-level: 10.
            - "brotli" : min-level: 0, max-level: 11.
            - "zstd" : min-level: 1, max-level: 22.

        statistics
            Write statistics to the parquet headers. This is the default behavior.

            Possible values:

            - `True`: enable default set of statistics (default). Some
              statistics may be disabled.
            - `False`: disable all statistics
            - "full": calculate and write all available statistics. Cannot be
              combined with `use_pyarrow`.
            - `{ "statistic-key": True / False, ... }`. Cannot be combined with
              `use_pyarrow`. Available keys:

              - "min": column minimum value (default: `True`)
              - "max": column maximum value (default: `True`)
              - "distinct_count": number of unique column values (default: `False`)
              - "null_count": number of null values in column (default: `True`)
        row_group_size
            Size of the row groups in number of rows. Defaults to 512^2 rows.
        data_page_size
            Size of the data page in bytes. Defaults to 1024^2 bytes.
        maintain_order
            Maintain the order in which data is processed.
            Setting this to `False` can be much faster.

        separator
            Separate CSV fields with this symbol.

        quote_char

        batch_size
            Number of rows that will be processed per thread.
        datetime_format
            A format string, with the specifiers defined by the

            Rust crate. If no format specified, the default fractional-second

        float_scientific
            Whether to use scientific form always (true), never (false), or
            automatically (None) for `Float32` and `Float64` datatypes.
        float_precision
            Number of decimal places to write, applied to both `Float32` and
            `Float64` datatypes.
        decimal_comma
            Use a comma as the decimal separator instead of a point. Floats will be
            encapsulated in quotes if necessary; set the field separator to override.
        null_value
            A string representing null values (defaulting to the empty string).
        quote_style : {'necessary', 'always', 'non_numeric', 'never'}
            Determines the quoting strategy used.

            - necessary (default): This puts quotes around fields only when necessary.
              They are necessary when fields contain a quote,
              delimiter or record terminator.
              Quotes are also necessary when writing an empty record
              (which is indistinguishable from a record with one empty field).
              This is the default.
            - always: This puts quotes around every field. Always.
            - never: This never puts quotes around fields, even if that results in
              invalid CSV data (e.g.: by not quoting strings containing the
              separator).
            - non_numeric: This puts quotes around all fields that are non-numeric.
              Namely, when writing a field that does not parse as a valid float
              or integer, then quotes will be used even if they aren`t strictly
              necessary.

            Choose "snappy" for more backwards compatibility guarantees
            when you deal with older parquet readers.
        compression_level
            The level of compression to use. Higher compression means smaller files on
            disk.

            - "gzip" : min-level: 0, max-level: 10.
            - "brotli" : min-level: 0, max-level: 11.

        statistics
            Write statistics to the parquet headers. This is the default behavior.

            Possible values:

            - `True`: enable default set of statistics (default). Some
              statistics may be disabled.
            - `False`: disable all statistics
            - "full": calculate and write all available statistics. Cannot be
              combined with `use_pyarrow`.
            - `{ "statistic-key": True / False, ... }`. Cannot be combined with
              `use_pyarrow`. Available keys:

              - "min": column minimum value (default: `True`)
              - "max": column maximum value (default: `True`)
              - "distinct_count": number of unique column values (default: `False`)
              - "null_count": number of null values in column (default: `True`)
        row_group_size
            Size of the row groups in number of rows. Defaults to 512^2 rows.
        data_page_size
            Size of the data page in bytes. Defaults to 1024^2 bytes.
        maintain_order
            Maintain the order in which data is processed.
            Setting this to `False` can be much faster.

        separator
            Separate CSV fields with this symbol.

            Number of rows that will be processed per thread.
        datetime_format
            A format string, with the specifiers defined by the

            Rust crate. If no format specified, the default fractional-second

            Rust crate.
        float_scientific
            Whether to use scientific form always (true), never (false), or
            automatically (None) for `Float32` and `Float64` datatypes.
        float_precision
            Number of decimal places to write, applied to both `Float32` and
            `Float64` datatypes.
        decimal_comma
            Use a comma as the decimal separator instead of a point. Floats will be
            encapsulated in quotes if necessary; set the field separator to override.
        null_value
            A string representing null values (defaulting to the empty string).
        quote_style : {'necessary', 'always', 'non_numeric', 'never'}
            Determines the quoting strategy used.

            - necessary (default): This puts quotes around fields only when necessary.
              They are necessary when fields contain a quote,
              delimiter or record terminator.
              Quotes are also necessary when writing an empty record
              (which is indistinguishable from a record with one empty field).
              This is the default.
            - always: This puts quotes around every field. Always.
            - never: This never puts quotes around fields, even if that results in
              invalid CSV data (e.g.: by not quoting strings containing the
              separator).
            - non_numeric: This puts quotes around all fields that are non-numeric.
              Namely, when writing a field that does not parse as a valid float
              or integer, then quotes will be used even if they aren`t strictly
              necessary.
        maintain_order
            Maintain the order in which data is processed.

            credentials. The function is expected to return a dictionary of
            credential keys along with an optional credential expiry time.

            .. warning::
                This functionality is considered **unstable**. It may be changed
                at any point without it being considered a breaking change.
        sink_to_single_file
            Perform the sink into a single file.

            Setting this to `True` can reduce the amount of work that can be done in a
            distributed manner and therefore be more memory intensive and
            slower.
        optimizations
            The optimization passes done during query optimization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        uri
            Path to which the output should be written.
            Must be a URI to an accessible object store location.

            It is recommended to write to a directory path
            for example `"my-location/"`, instead of as single file
            as a single file can only be written from a single
            node.

            If set to `"local"`, the query is executed locally.
        compression : {'uncompressed', 'lz4', 'zstd'}
            Choose "zstd" for good compression performance.
            Choose "lz4" for fast compression/decompression.
        compat_level
            Use a specific compatibility level
            when exporting Polars' internal data structures.
        maintain_order
            Maintain the order in which data is processed.
            Setting this to `False` can be much faster.

                point without it being considered a breaking change.
        storage_options
            Options that indicate how to connect to a cloud provider.

            The cloud providers currently supported are AWS, GCP, and Azure.
            See supported keys here:

            * `aws <https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/aws/enum.AmazonS3ConfigKey.html>`_
            * `gcp <https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/gcp/enum.GoogleConfigKey.html>`_
            * `azure <https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/azure/enum.AzureConfigKey.html>`_
            * Hugging Face (`hf://`): Accepts an API key under the `token` parameter: \
            `{'token': '...'}`, or by setting the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable.

            If `storage_options` is not provided, Polars will try to infer the
            information from environment variables.
