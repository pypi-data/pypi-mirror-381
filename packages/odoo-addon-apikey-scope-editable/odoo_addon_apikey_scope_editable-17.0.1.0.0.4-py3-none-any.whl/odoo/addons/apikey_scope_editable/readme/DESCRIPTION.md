This module extends the built-in [Odoo API Keys](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/developer/reference/external_api.html#api-keys) by allowing you to define a scope at the moment of creation.

With scopes, you can restrict an API Key so that it only grants access to a specific application, model, or functional area of the system.
