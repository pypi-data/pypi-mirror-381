Artificial Intelligence Development Framework

Batteries included AI development as deterministic as possible while empowering the probabilistic nature of intelligence.

Get started by installing with `pip install dandy` and then check out our [documentation](https://dandysoftware.com) for more detailed steps.

### Features

- **Pythonic:** Use Python to handle all data instead of messy strings, so youâ€™re always working with code.
- **Customizable:** Adjust how the AI works at any time by switching between different tools, models, services and settings.
- **Simple:** We put developers first, so chaining tools and logic flow are straightforward and very readable.
- **Reliable:** Dandy is designed with self-correction and will automatically adjust to get the correct result.

### Documentation

Check out the [Dandy Website](https://dandysoftware.com) for documentation including tutorials and more.
