# Features not currently implemented

There are many features that are not currently implemented in H2Integrate that are necessary for current or future projects.
These will become issues on the H2Integrate GitHub repo.
We are listing them here:

- splitting out HOPP into individual systems, including dispatch
- allowing different technologies within the same plant to be at different sites
- saving results elegantly for plant components so they do not always need to be rerun
- detailing the required inputs and outputs for different model types (e.g. electrolyzer) so that users can more easily add their own subsystems
- splitters and combiners for when resources are used or produced by multiple components
- simulating different timespans than one year at hourly timesteps (8760s)
