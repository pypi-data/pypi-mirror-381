# Glossary

This is an incomplete glossary of terms that used in H2Integrate and this documentation.
The goal is to have this be a one-stop-shop for defining words and jargon.
Some of these words have a particular meaning within H2Integrate but might mean something else outside the tool, even in a technical setting.

```{glossary}

dispatch
    The process of determining how energy is passed to different components of a hybrid energy system, e.g. how much energy is sent to a battery, how much is sent to a electrolyzer, etc.
    This might include using a heuristic method or determining the optimal operation of each component in the system.
    The dispatch algorithm is the set of rules that determine how to operate the system.

load
    The amount of energy that a component of a hybrid energy system requires to operate.
    This could be the amount of electricity needed to power a building, the amount of hydrogen needed to fuel a vehicle, etc.
