Description: This file implements electrolzyer CapEx and OpEx models from [1]. The exact extent of
    what is included in the costs is unclear in [1]. Source [2] (cited by [1]) states that
    "equipment costs include the electrolyser system, the filling centre or compressor skids and
    storage systems".
