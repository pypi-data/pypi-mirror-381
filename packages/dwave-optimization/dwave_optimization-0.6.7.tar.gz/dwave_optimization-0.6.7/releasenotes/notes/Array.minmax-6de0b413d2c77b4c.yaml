features:
  - |
    Add C++ ``Array::minmax()`` method that accepts a ``cache`` argument.
    This method can avoid a potentially expensive depth first search through
    the node graph.
    See `#182 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-optimization/issues/182>`_.
upgrade:
  - |
    The C++ ``Array::min()`` and ``Array::max()`` methods are no longer ``virtual``,
    but instead call the more general ``Array::minmax()`` method. Subclasses of
    ``Array`` should ``override`` the ``Array::minmax()`` method instead.
