features:
  - |
    Add C++ ``LogicalNode`` and Python ``Logical`` symbol. ``Logical`` propagates the truth value(s) of its
    predecessor element-wise.
  - |
    Add C++ ``NotNode`` and Python ``Not`` symbol. ``Not`` propagates the inverse of the truth value(s)
    of its predecessor element-wise.
fixes:
  - |
    Implement C++ ``UnaryOpNode::max()``, ``UnaryOpNode::min()``, and ``UnaryOpNode::logical()``.
    Therefore ``AbsoluteNode``, ``NegativeNode``, and ``SquareNode`` will now correctly
    propagate their minimum and maximum value
    and will now correctly report if they represent integer or boolean values.
