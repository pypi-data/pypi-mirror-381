    Fix two bugs in advanced indexing node propogation in the case of a
    non-const main array with dynamic indexers, e.g. ``A[x]`` where ``A`` is a
    1d integer decision variable and ``x`` is a list. The first bug could cause
    segfaults during propagation, and the second could lead to incorrect output
    if both arrays were changed during propagation.
