    Fix bug in basic indexing propagation that may have caused some updates
    from the predecessor array to not get propagated when the start of the
    indexing operation was offset from the start of the predecessor array.
    This would happen only when the predecessor array is statically sized or
    the start and stop of the domain are both positive.
