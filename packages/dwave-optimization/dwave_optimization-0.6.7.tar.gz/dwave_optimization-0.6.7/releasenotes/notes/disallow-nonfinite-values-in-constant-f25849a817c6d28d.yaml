    Previously, `Constant` symbols could be created from data that contained
    NaNs or infinite float values. Since these values, especially NaN, can
    cause issues during propagation when not expected, they could cause the
    model to exhibit incorrect behavior. As such, providing these values to
    initialize a `Constant` symbol is now disallowed.
