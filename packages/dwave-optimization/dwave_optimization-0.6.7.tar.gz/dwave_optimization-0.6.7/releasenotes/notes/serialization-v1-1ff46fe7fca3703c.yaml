    Add support for serialization format version 1.0. This format is more
    efficient for storing the states of fixed-size array symbols. It also
    supports saving the states of nondeterministic intermediate array symbols.
    The default serialzation format is not yet changed.
  - Add ``substitute`` keyword argument to ``Model.from_file()``.
