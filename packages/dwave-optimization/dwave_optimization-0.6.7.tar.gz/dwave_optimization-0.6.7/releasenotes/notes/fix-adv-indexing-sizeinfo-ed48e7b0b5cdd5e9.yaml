    Previously, the size info as reported by `ArrayIndexingNode` was correct
    only when the advanced indexing operation had no empty slices (i.e. all
    axes were specified with indexing arrays), and even in that case, the full
    size information from the indexing predecessors was not utilized. This has
    been fixed, so certain operations on advanced indexing nodes may now be
    allowed that weren't previously, and a size check may fail on certain models
    that worked before (operations such as `A + B[i, :, j, :]` where `A` is a
    dynamic 2d array, and `i` and `j` are dynamic 1d arrays, but the dimensions
    do not match).
