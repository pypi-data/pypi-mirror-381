features:
  - |
    Support both lvalue and rvalue ranges in the constructor of the C++
    ``ArrayOutputMixin`` class.
  - Rework C++ ``ReshapeNode`` constructors to be more general.
  - |
    Support inferring the shape of one axis when reshaping array symbols by providing
    ``-1`` for the dimension's shape.
  - Support reshaping non-contiguous array symbols.
  - Add C++ ``CopyNode``. See `#16 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-optimization/issues/16>`_.
  - Add ``Copy`` symbol. See `#16 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-optimization/issues/16>`_.
fixes:
  - |
    Add missing C++ ``ReshapeNode::max()``, ``::min()``, and ``::integral()`` methods.
    Thereby allowing reshaped arrays to be used as indices.
