features:
  - |
    Add a new Cython extension type, ``_Graph``. The ``_Graph`` class is
    responsible for managing a C++ ``dwave::optimization::Graph``.
    Also make ``Model`` a Python class that inherits from ``_Graph``, rather than
    a Cython extension type.
upgrade:
  - |
    It is no longer possible to ``from dwave.optimization.model cimport Model``.
    Instead, importers should ``from dwave.optimization.model cimport _Graph``.
    A ``_Graph`` has most of the functionality that a ``Model`` did, although
    most of the symbol construction methods have been kept on ``Model``.
