cdef class AccumulateZip(ArraySymbol):
    """Using a supplied :class:`~dwave.optimization.model.Expression`, perform
    an element-wise accumulate operation along one or more array operands. The
    accumulate operation (represented by the ``Expression``) takes as input one
    value from each of the operand arrays, as well as the result of the
    previously computed operation, and computes a new value at the next output
    index.

    This takes inspiration from
    `numpy.ufunc.accumulate <https://numpy.org/doc/2.1/reference/generated/numpy.ufunc.accumulate.html>`_ 
    but is different in that the accumulate operation can take an arbitrary
    number of arguments, instead of always two. These arguments come from
    "zipping" the supplied predecessor arrays together.

    Thus if we are given an expression `expr`, predecessor arrays `A`, `B`,
    `C`, and an initial value `init`, this node is equivalent to the
    pseudocode:

    .. code-block::

        r = [0] * len(A)
        t = init
        for args in zip(A, B, C):
            t = expr(t, *args)
            r[i] = t
        return r

    Args:
        expression:
            An :class:`~dwave.optimization.model.Expression` representing the
            accumulate operation. The first input on the expression will be given
            the previous output of the operation at each iteration over the
            values of the operands.
        operands:
            A list of the 1d-array symbols that will be the operands to the
            accumulate. There should be one fewer operands than inputs on the
            expression.
        initial (optional):
            A float representing the value used to start the accumulate. This
            will be used to set the last input of the expression on the very
            first iteration.
