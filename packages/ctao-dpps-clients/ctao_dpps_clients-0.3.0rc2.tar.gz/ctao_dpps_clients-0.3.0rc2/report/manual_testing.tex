During this sprint, the configuration of RSEs was tested in a pre-production
setup at PIC.
The two connected RSEs that were used to successfully transfer
data between the Onsite ICT and PIC were a GridFTP endpoint onsite and the dCache at PIC.
Transfers were achieved with the gsiftp protocol using the FTS server at PIC.
