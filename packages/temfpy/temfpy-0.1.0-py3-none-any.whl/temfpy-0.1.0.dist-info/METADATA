# TeMFpy: Tensor-Network Mean-Field Python

[TeMFpy](https://github.com/temfpy/temfpy) (**Te**nsor Networks for **M**ean-**F**ield States in **Py**thon, suggested pronuncation: ˈtɛmɸ.paɪ) is a [TeNPy](https://tenpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-based Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. Being built on top of TeNPy, it integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.

## Installation
TeMFpy runs on all operating systems and requires Python 3.10 or later. We support installation through pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade temfpy
```

We will set up installation via Conda in the near future.

If you use Windows and want to use the Pfaffian-state functionality, [make sure you install the `pfapack` dependency correctly!](https://pfapack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\#usage)

## Documentation

The documentation is available [on this website](https://temfpy.github.io/temfpy). In addition, every object in TeMFpy comes with detailed docstrings that are available through the `help()` function in Python.

## Contribute

The most up-to-date version of TeMFpy is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/temfpy/temfpy). If you find any bugs in the library, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/temfpy/temfpy/issues), including a minimal example to reproduce the issue.

We also welcome contributions, whether bug fixes or new features, please see our [contributor guidelines](https://temfpy.github.io/temfpy/getting_started/contribute.html) for details.
