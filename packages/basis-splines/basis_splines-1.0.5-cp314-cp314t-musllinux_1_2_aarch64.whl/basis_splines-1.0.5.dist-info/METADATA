# Basis-splines

![2-dimensional spline in basis form with convex hull](https://github.com/phdorp/basis-splines/blob/main/docs/media/spline2d_allDims.jpg)

This project includes a C++ library implementing multi-dimensional polynomial splines in basis form and operations to form new splines that represent the derivative, integral, sum, and product of splines.
Among other things, polynomial splines are relevant for computer graphics and to solve semi-infinite programs resulting from optimal control problems.
For example [omg-tools](https://github.com/meco-group/omg-tools) provides a python framework for the formulation and solution of such problems.
This project provides a performant C++ implementation of relevant spline operations in this context.

## Installation

```bash
pip install basis-splines
```

## Usage

Please refer to [Github](https://github.com/phdorp/basis-splines) to view a detailed documentation and examples.
