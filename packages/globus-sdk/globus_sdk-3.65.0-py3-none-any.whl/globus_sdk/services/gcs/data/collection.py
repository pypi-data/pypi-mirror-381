#
# NOTE -- on the organization of arguments in this module --
#
# The arguments to each collection type are defined explicitly for good type annotations
# and documentation.
# However, it's easy for things to get out of sync or different between the various
# locations, so we need to impose some order on things to make comparisons easy.
#
# Complicating this, there are some arguments to specific types which aren't shared
# by the common base.
#
# The rule and rationale used is as follows:
# - DATA_TYPE is special, and always first
# - next, the common optional arguments (shared by all)
# - after that, the specific optional arguments for this type/subtype
# - 'additional_fields' is special, and always last
#
# within those listings of common and specific arguments, the following ordering is
# maintained:
# - strings, sorted alphabetically
# - string lists, sorted alphabetically
# - bools, sorted alphabetically
# - ints, sorted alphabetically
# - dicts and other types, sorted alphabetically
#
# This makes it possible to do side-by-side comparison of common arguments, to ensure
# that they are all present and accounted-for in all contexts, and allows us to compare
# definition lists for param docs and arguments against usage sites to ensure that all
# arguments which are passed are actually used

    This is the base class for :class:`~.MappedCollectionDocument` and
    :class:`~.GuestCollectionDocument`.

    Parameters common to both of those are defined and documented here.

    :param data_type: Explicitly set the ``DATA_TYPE`` value for this collection.
        Normally ``DATA_TYPE`` is deduced from the provided parameters and should not be
        set. To maximize compatibility with different versions of GCS, only set this
        value when necessary.

    :param collection_base_path: The location of the collection on its underlying
        storage. For a mapped collection, this is an absolute path on the storage system
        named by the ``storage_gateway_id``. For a guest collection, this is a path
        relative to the value of the ``root_path`` attribute on the mapped collection
        identified by the ``mapped_collection_id``. This parameter is optional for
        updates but required when creating a new collection.
    :param contact_email: Email address of the support contact for the collection
    :param contact_info: Other contact information for the collection, e.g. phone number
        or mailing address
    :param default_directory: Default directory when using the collection
    :param department: The department which operates the collection
    :param description: A text description of the collection
    :param display_name: Friendly name for the collection
    :param identity_id: The Globus Auth identity which acts as the owner of the
        collection
    :param info_link: Link for more info about the collection
    :param organization: The organization which maintains the collection
    :param restrict_transfers_to_high_assurance: Require that transfers of the
        given type involve only collections that are high assurance.
        Valid values: "inbound", "outbound", "all", None
    :param user_message: A message to display to users when interacting with this
        collection
    :param user_message_link: A link to additional messaging for users when interacting
        with this collection

    :param keywords: A list of keywords used to help searches for the collection

    :param disable_verify: Disable verification checksums on transfers to and from this
        collection
    :param enable_https: Enable or disable HTTPS support (requires a managed endpoint)
    :param force_encryption: When set to True, all transfers to and from the collection
        are always encrypted
    :param force_verify: Force verification checksums on transfers to and from this
        collection
    :param public: If True, the collection will be visible to other Globus users

    :param acl_expiration_mins: Length of time that guest collection permissions are
        valid. Only settable on HA guest collections and HA mapped collections and
        used by guest collections attached to it. When set on both the mapped and guest
        collections, the lesser value is in effect.

    :param associated_flow_policy: Policy describing Globus flows to run when the
        collection is accessed. See
        https://docs.globus.org/api/transfer/endpoints_and_collections/#associated_flow_policy
