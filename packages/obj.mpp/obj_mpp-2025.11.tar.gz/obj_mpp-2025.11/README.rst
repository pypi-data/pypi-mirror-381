Documentation
=============

The documentation is available at |DOCUMENTATION_URL|_.



Installation
============

This project is published
on the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/>`_
at: |PYPI_PROJECT_URL|_.
It should be installable from Python distribution platforms or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).
Otherwise, it can be installed from a command console using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`_:

+==============+=======================================================+==========================================================+
| Installation | ``pip install`` |PYPI_NAME_LITERAL|                   | ``pip install --user`` |PYPI_NAME_LITERAL|               |

| Update       | ``pip install --upgrade`` |PYPI_NAME_LITERAL|         | ``pip install --user --upgrade`` |PYPI_NAME_LITERAL|     |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+



Dependencies
============

The development relies on several packages:

- Mandatory: |DEPENDENCIES_MANDATORY|
- Optional:  |DEPENDENCIES_OPTIONAL|

The mandatory dependencies, if any, are installed automatically by `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`_, if they are not already, as part of the installation of |PROJECT_NAME|.
Python distribution platforms or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) should also take care of this.
The optional dependencies, if any, must be installed independently by following the related instructions, for added functionalities of |PROJECT_NAME|.



Implementation notes
====================

- The optional, periodic detection refinement step is not part of the original Marked Point Process object detection method (see the Gamal Eldin *et al* reference in the documentation). It is an heuristic addition.
- When using the refinement step, Xavier Descombes noticed that, after some iterations, each iteration was taking very long to complete. He hypothesized that the refinement step was applied in each iteration instead of happening with the specified period. He was right: the reset of the refinement-related counter after application had been forgotten.
