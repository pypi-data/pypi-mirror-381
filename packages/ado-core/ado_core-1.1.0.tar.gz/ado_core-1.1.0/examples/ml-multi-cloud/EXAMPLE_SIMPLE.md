## The scenario

When you deploy a workload you have to choose values for workload parameters
like the number of CPUs or the node type. To choose a combination of parameters
that, for example, maximizes performance, a common strategy is to measure
changes in performance by **exploring the workload parameter space**. This
pattern applies to many domains where there is a parameter space to explore.

**In this example `ado` is used to explore the workload parameter space for a
cloud application.** To explore a workload parameter space you have to:

- define the values of the parameters to test - the parameter space
- define what to test them with - the experiment
- select points from the parameter space and perform the test - the sampling
  method

Here, we will use the simplest sampling method, random walk, where some number
of points are randomly selected without replacement.

> [!CAUTION]

> The commands below assume you are in the directory `examples/ml-multi-cloud`
> in **the ado source repository**. See
> [the instructions for cloning the repository](/ado/getting-started/install/#__tabbed_1_3).

## Using pre-existing data with `ado`

For this example we will use some **pre-existing data**. This makes the example
simpler and quicker to execute but can also be useful in other situations. The
data is in the file `ml_export.csv` and is consists of results of running a
benchmark on different cloud hardware configurations from different providers.

In `ado` such configurations are called `entities`, and are stored, along with
the results of measurements executed on them, in a
[`samplestore`](/ado/resources/sample-stores). Let's start by copying the data
in `ml_export.csv` into a new `samplestore`.

To do this execute,

```commandline
ado create samplestore -f ml_multicloud_sample_store.yaml --set "copyFrom[0].storageLocation.path"=ml_export.csv
```

and it will report that a `samplestore` has been created:

```commandline
Success! Created sample store with identifier $SAMPLE_STORE_IDENTIFIER
```

Note the `samplestore` resource identifier printed by this command for the next
section.

Also try `ado get samplestores` and you will see an entry for the one you just
created

!!! info end
    <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line code-block-style -->
    You only need to create this `samplestore` once.
    It can be reused in multiple `discoveryspaces`
    or examples that require the `ml_export.csv` data.

## Creating a `discoveryspace` for the `ml-multi-cloud` data

A `discoveryspace` describes a set of points and how to measure them. Here we
will create a `discoveryspace` to describe the space explored in
`ml_export.csv`.

Execute:

```commandline
ado create space -f ml_multicloud_space.yaml --set "sampleStoreIdentifier=$SAMPLE_STORE_IDENTIFIER"
```

where `$SAMPLE_STORE_IDENTIFIER` is the identifier you copied in last step.

This will confirm the creation of the `discoveryspace` with:

```commandline
Success! Created space with identifier: $DISCOVERY_SPACE_IDENTIFIER
```

You can now describe the `discoveryspace` with:

```commandline
ado describe space $DISCOVERY_SPACE_IDENTIFIER
```

where $DISCOVERY_SPACE_IDENTIFIER is the identifier of the `discoveryspace`
resource that was just created. This will output:

```commandline
Identifier: space-65cf33-a8df39

Entity Space:

  Number entities: 48

  Categorical properties:
           name     values
    0  provider  [A, B, C]

  Discrete properties:
             name   range interval        values
    0  cpu_family  [0, 2]     None        [0, 1]
    1   vcpu_size  [0, 2]     None        [0, 1]
    2       nodes  [2, 6]     None  [2, 3, 4, 5]


Measurement Space:
                        experiment  supported
  0  replay.benchmark_performance       True

  'replay.benchmark_performance'

  Inputs:
      parameter      type value parameterized
  0  cpu_family  required  None            na
  1   vcpu_size  required  None            na
  2       nodes  required  None            na
  3    provider  required  None            na

  Outputs:
       target property
  0  wallClockRuntime
  1            status

Sample Store identifier: 'a8df39'
```

## Exploring the `discoveryspace`

Next we will run an operation that will "explore" the `discoveryspace` we just
created. Since we already have the data, `ado` will transparently identify and
reuse it. An example operation file is given in
`randomwalk_ml_multicloud_operation.yaml`. The contents are:

```yaml
{% include "./randomwalk_ml_multicloud_operation.yaml" %}
```

To run the operation execute (replacing `$DISCOVERY_SPACE_IDENTIFIER` with the
identifier of the space you created):

```commandline
ado create operation -f randomwalk_ml_multicloud_operation.yaml --set "spaces[0]=$DISCOVERY_SPACE_IDENTIFIER"
```

This will output a lot of information as it samples all the entities. Typically,
you will see the following lines for each entity (point in the entity space)
sampled and measured:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```commandline
(RandomWalk pid=14797) Continuous batching: SUBMIT EXPERIMENT. Submitting experiment replay.benchmark_performance for provider.B-cpu_family.1-vcpu_size.1-nodes.4
(RandomWalk pid=14797)
(RandomWalk pid=14797) Continuous batching: SUMMARY. Entities sampled and submitted: 2. Experiments completed: 1 Waiting on 1 active requests. There are 0 dependent experiments
(RandomWalk pid=14797) Continuous Batching: EXPERIMENT COMPLETION. Received finished notification for experiment in measurement request in group 1: request-randomwalk-0.9.6.dev91+884f713b.dirty-c5ed4b-579021-experiment-benchmark_performance-entities-provider.B-cpu_family.1-vcpu_size.1-nodes.4 (explicit_grid_sample_generator)-requester-randomwalk-0.9.6.dev91+884f713b.dirty-c5ed4b-time-2025-07-29 20:03:00.976809+01:00
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

The first line, "SUBMIT EXPERIMENT", indicates the entity -
`provider.B-cpu_family.1-vcpu_size.1-nodes.4` - and experiment -
`replay.benchmark_performance` submitted. The next line gives a summary of what
has happened so far: this is the second entity sampled and submitted; one
experiment has completed; and the sampler is waiting on one active experiment
before submitting a new one. Finally, the "EXPERIMENT COMPLETION" line indicates
the experiment has finished.

The operation will end with information like:

```yaml

## Looking at the `operation` output

The command

```commandline
ado show entities operation $OPERATION_IDENTIFIER
```

displays the results of the operation i.e. the entities sampled and the
measurement results. You will see something like the following (the sampling is
random so the order can be different):

> [!TIP] Some things to note and consider:
>
> - The table is in the order the points were measured
> - Some points have multiple measurements c.f. size of entityspace versus the
>   number of rows in `ml_export.csv`.
> - Some points were not measured - these are points in the discoveryspace for
>   which no data was present to replay.

## Exploring Further

Here are a variety of commands you can try after executing the example above:

### Viewing entities

There are multiple ways to few the entities related to a `discoveryspace`. Try:

```commandline
ado show entities space $DISCOVERY_SPACE_IDENTIFIER
ado show entities space $DISCOVERY_SPACE_IDENTIFIER --aggregate mean
ado show entities space $DISCOVERY_SPACE_IDENTIFIER --include unmeasured
ado show entities space $DISCOVERY_SPACE_IDENTIFIER --property-format target
```

Also,

```commandline
ado show details space $DISCOVERY_SPACE_IDENTIFIER
```

will give you a summary of what has been measured.

### Resource provenance

The `related` sub-command shows resource provenance e.g.

```commandline
ado show related operation $OPERATION_IDENTIFIER
```

### Operation timeseries

The following commands give more details of the operation timeseries

```commandline
ado show results operation $OPERATION_IDENTIFIER
ado show requests operation $OPERATION_IDENTIFIER
```

### Resource templates

Another helpful command is `template` which will output a default example of a
resource YAML along with an (optional) description of its fields. Try:

```commandline
ado template operation --include-schema --operator-name random_walk
```

### Rerun

An interesting thing to try is to run the operation again and compare the output
of `show entities operation` for the two operations, and `show entities space`.

## Takeaways

- **create-explore-view pattern**: A common pattern in `ado` is to create a
  `discoveryspace` to describe a set of points to measure, create `operations`
  on it to explore or analyse it, and then view the results
- **entity space and measurement space**: A `discoveryspace` consists of an
  `entityspace` - the set of points to measure - and a `measurementspace` - the
  set of experiments to apply to them.
- **operations are domain agnostic**: `ado` enables operations to run on
  multiple different domains without modification
- **memoization**: By default `ado` will identify if a measurement has already
  been completed on an entity and reuse it
- **provenance**: `ado` stores the relationship between the resources it creates
- **results viewing**: `ado show entities` outputs the data in a
  `discoveryspace` or measured in an `operation`
