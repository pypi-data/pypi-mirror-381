The following videos give a glimpse of using ado to benchmark fine-tuning
performance across a range of fine-tuning workload configurations.

## List actuators and experiments

First we list the experiments given by the `SFTTrainer`
[actuator](../actuators/working-with-actuators.md), which provides fine-tuning
benchmarking capabilities. We can use `ado` to get the details of one of the
experiments `finetune_full_benchmark-v1.0.0` and see what it requires as input
and what it measures.

## Create a `discoveryspace` to explore fine-tuning performance

Next we create a `discoveryspace` that represents a fine-tuning benchmarking
campaign. For quick start we use `ado`s `template` functionality to create a
default configuration space for `lora` and `full` fine-tuning benchmark
experiments.

## Explore the `discoveryspace` with a RandomWalk

This clip shows looking at the available operators and then creating a
[RandomWalk](../operators/random-walk.md) [operation](../resources/operation.md)
to explore the discovery space created above. The operation is configured to
sample all 40 of the configurations, a.k.a.
[entities](../core-concepts/entity-spaces.md), in the `discoveryspace`. After
the operation is finished we can look results at a summary of the operation and
get the results as a CSV file.

## Examine spaces collaborators have created

`ado` enables multiple distributed users can work on the same project. Here
another user can query the `discoveryspaces` created by their colleagues,
including in this case the one created above. Resources, like `discoveryspaces`,
can be tagged with custom metadata. For example, in this clip the user requests
a summary of all spaces tagged with `exp=ft`. They then apply a custom export
operator to the data which in this case integrates new data with an external
store in a rigorous and repeatable way.
