## Discovery Space

The core concept in `ado` is called a _Discovery Space_. In `ado` you are often
creating and performing operations on Discovery Spaces.

For users familiar with `pandas` and `dataframes`, a Discovery Space combines:

- the schema of a `dataframe` i.e. the columns and what they mean
- instructions on how to fill the `dataframe` rows
- the current data in the `dataframe` (and what's missing!)

So a Discovery Space allows expressing the hidden metadata and contextual
information necessary to understand and extend a dataframe. See
[Discovery Space](discovery-spaces.md) for more details.

A Discovery Space is built from:

- [Entities and Entity Spaces](entity-spaces.md): The set of things in a
  Discovery Space
- [Measurement Spaces](actuators.md#measurement-space): The set of experiments
  in a Discovery Space
- [Experiments and Actuators](actuators.md): The available experiments and the
  tools that execute them

## Sample Store

In `ado` data on sampled entities, and the results of experiments on them, are
kept in a **sample store**.

A single sample store can be used by multiple Discovery Spaces, allowing them to
share data. This means, for example, if an experiment has already been run,
`ado` can reuse the existing results instead of running the experiment again,
saving time and compute resources.

This ability to transparently share and reuse data is a core feature of `ado`.
See [Shared Sample Stores](data-sharing.md) for more details.
