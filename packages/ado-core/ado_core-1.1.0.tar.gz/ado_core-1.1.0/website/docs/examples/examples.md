## Tutorial

Our short tutorial, [Taking a random walk](random-walk.md), introduces core
`ado` concepts and is the recommend place to start.

## General Examples

The following examples illustrate general features of `ado`. They build on the
concepts learned in the tutorial and leverage pre-existing data and/or toy
measurements so they run quickly.

- [Search a space with an optimizer](best-configuration-search.md)
- [Search a space based on a custom objective function](search-custom-objective.md)
- [Identify the important dimensions of a space](lhu.md)

After following these examples you can also try applying capabilities learned in
one example to another.

## Foundation Models Characterization

The following examples illustrate using the vllm_performance and SFTTrainer
actuators which provide benchmarking experiments for foundation model inference
and fine-tuning respectively.

- [Measure throughput of fine-tuning locally](finetune-locally.md)

## Adding experiments or analysis tools to `ado`

The
[search a space based on a custom objective function](search-custom-objective.md)
example, combines with the
[creating a custom experiment](../actuators/creating-custom-experiments.md)
documentation to illustrate a simple method for adding your own experiments to
`ado`.

For adding actuators, we provide an
[example template actuator repository](https://github.com/IBM/ado/tree/main/plugins/actuators/example_actuator)
that can be used with our
[documentation on writing actuators](../actuators/creating-actuator-classes.md).

For adding operators, we have an
[example template operator repository](https://github.com/IBM/ado/tree/main/plugins/actuators/example_actuator)
that can be used with our
[documentation on writing operators](../operators/creating-operators.md).
