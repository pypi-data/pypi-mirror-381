# Architectural Decisions

Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales. With “decisions” we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented here in this central section or whether you better document it locally (e.g. within the white box template of one building block). Avoid redundant texts. Refer to section {ref}`sec_solution_strategy`, where you captured the most important decisions of your architecture already.

```{todo}
Add {ref}`sec_architectural_decisions`, see [arc42-guideline](https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/). Siehe dazu auch {cite:p}`aim42`.
```

% Architecture decisions can be defined anywhere. The following table gathers them in one place.
