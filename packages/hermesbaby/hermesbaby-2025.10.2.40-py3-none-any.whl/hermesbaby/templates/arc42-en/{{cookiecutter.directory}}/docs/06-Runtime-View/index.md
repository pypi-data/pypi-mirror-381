# Runtime View

The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

- important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
- interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighbouring systems?
- operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
- error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevancy*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.
