# Building Block View

The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, â€¦) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation. In analogy to a house this is the *floor plan*.

```{todo}
Add {ref}`sec_building_block_view`, see [arc42-guideline](https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/)
