{{ prolog }}

The Advanced Encryption Standard is a symmetric block cipher, based on the
Rijndael cipher. It was standardised by NIST in 2001 on [FIPS 197][FIPS197].

## Overview

There are three variants standardised by [FIPS 197][FIPS197]: AES-128, AES-192,
AES-256. The differences between variants are the key size (128, 192, and 256
bits respectively) and the number of rounds.

All three variants have a block size of 128 bits, meaning that they can only
encrypt or decrypt 128 bits of data. To address larger data sizes, they are used
with a *mode of operation*, which chains calls to the block cipher to process
arbitrary amounts of data[^arbitrary].

[^arbitrary]: There are limitations linked to the key size and IV to maintain
    the security guarantees of the system.

### Modes of operation

There are two types of modes of operation: confidentiality-only and
authenticated modes. The latter ensures both the confidentiality of the message
as well as its integrity, so using these modes should be preferred when
possible. Note that confidentiality-only modes are used by authenticated modes,
and that the following recommendations apply when using these modes to construct
authenticated ones.

#### Confidentiality-only modes

These modes of operation require an IV, which must either be:

- a value generated with a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number
  generator;
- a value that must be used only once (a *nonce*).

The different modes of operation are:

- - Mode

- - CTR
  - {green}`Recommended`
  - Stream mode: never re-use the same (key, IV) pair as this allows an attacker to recover the XOR of both plaintexts.
- - OFB
  - {green}`Recommended`
  - Stream mode: never re-use the same (key, IV) pair as this allows an attacker to recover the XOR of both plaintexts.
- - CBC
  - {green}`Recommended`

    - Requires padding, as it treats messages whose length is a multiple of the block size. Since it requires padding, implementations must ensure the decryption process prevents padding oracle attacks.
    - TLS 1.3 has eliminated support for CBC.

#### Authenticated modes

The modes GCM, CCM, and EAX are recommended when used with a recommended
primitive such as AES.

- - Mode
  - Status
  - Comments
- - CCM
  - {green}`Recommended`
  -
- - GCM
  - {green}`Recommended`
  -
    - Never re-use an IV. GCM, like other counter modes, is a stream cipher, so using the same (key, IV) pair leaks information on the plaintext.
    - GCM is only recommended if the IV is 96 bits long and is constructed with the deterministic construction.
    - Given that the block size of AES is 128 bits, a single key can be used to encrypt up to {math}`2^{39} - 256` bits or {math}`2^{32} - 2` blocks.
    - The MAC must be at least 128 bits, meaning that it can't be truncated.
- - EAX
  - {green}`Recommended`

### Constructions

Constructions refer to ways of combining a (block) cipher with a Message
Authentication Code (MAC) to ensure both the confidentiality and the
authenticity of the message.
