# Tyger: a simple type analysis tool

Tyger is a simple analysis tool developed to implement different type disciplines in Python. 

The package includes defines the necessary interfaces to implement a type discipline. It also comes with two currently 
in development interfaces: a simple gradual type system and a gradual security type system.

The main subjects of study of this project are gradual type system. This is defined in the abstract base discipline. 
The gradual system is based on the AGT methodology. 

## Installation

Package must be installed for testing. To install in development mode, use
