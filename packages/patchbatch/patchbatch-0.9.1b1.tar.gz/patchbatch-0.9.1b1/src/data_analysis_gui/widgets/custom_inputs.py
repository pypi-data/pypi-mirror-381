Enhanced GUI input widgets for improved user experience.

This module provides custom Qt widget subclasses that enhance the default behavior
of standard input controls. These widgets improve usability by providing automatic
text selection, preventing accidental value changes from mouse wheel events, and
other user-friendly behaviors.

Classes:
    - SelectAllLineEdit: QLineEdit with automatic text selection on focus
    - SelectAllSpinBox: QDoubleSpinBox with text selection and wheel event blocking
    - SelectAllIntSpinBox: QSpinBox with text selection and wheel event blocking
    - NoScrollComboBox: QComboBox that ignores mouse wheel events

Features:
    - Automatic text selection for faster data entry
    - Mouse wheel event blocking to prevent accidental changes
    - Consistent behavior across different input widget types
    - Drop-in replacements for standard Qt input widgets
