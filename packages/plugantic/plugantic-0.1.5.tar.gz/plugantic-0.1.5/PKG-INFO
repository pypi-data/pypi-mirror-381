# 🧩 Plugantic - Simplified extendable composition with pydantic

## 🤔 Why use `plugantic`?

You may have learned that you should avoid inheritance in favor of composition. When using pydantic you can achieve that by using something like the following:

```python
# Declare a base config
class OutputConfig(BaseModel):
    mode: str
    def print(self): ...

# Declare all implementations of the base config
class TextConfig(OutputConfig):
    mode: Literal["text"] = "text"
    text: str
    def print(self):
        print(self.text)

class NumberConfig(OutputConfig):
    mode: Literal["number"] = "number"
    number: float
    precision: int = 2
    def print(self):
        print(f"{self.number:.{self.precision}f}")

# Define a union type of all implementations
AllOutputConfigs = Annotated[Union[
    TextConfig,
    NumberConfig,
], Field(discriminator="mode")]

# Use the union type in your model
class CommonConfig(BaseModel):
    output: AllOutputConfigs

...

CommonConfig.model_validate({"output": {
    "mode": "text",
    "text": "Hello World"
}})
```

Whilst this works, there are multiple issues and annoyances with that approach:
 - **Hard to maintain**: you need to declare a type union and update it with every change
 - **Not extensible**: adding a different config afterwards would required to update the `AllOutputConfigs` type and all of the objects using it
 - **Redundant definition** of the discriminator field (i.e. `Literal[<x>] = <x>`)

This library solves all of these issues (and more), so you can just write

```python
from plugantic import PluginModel

class OutputConfig(PluginModel):
    mode: str
    def print(self): ...

class TextConfig(OutputConfig):
    # No redundant "text" definition here!
    mode: Literal["text"]
    text: str
    def print(self):
        print(self.text)

class NumberConfig(OutputConfig):
    # No redundant definition here either!
    mode: Literal["number"]
    number: float
    precision: int = 2
    def print(self):
        print(f"{self.number:.{self.precision}f}")

# No need to define a union type or a discriminator field!
# You can just use the base type as a field type!
class CommonConfig(BaseModel):
    output: OutputConfig

# You can even add new configs after the fact!
class BytesConfig(OutputConfig):
    mode: Literal["bytes"]
    content: bytes
    def print(self):
        print(self.content.decode("utf-8"))

...

# The actual type is only evaluated when it is actually needed!
CommonConfig.model_validate({"output": {
    "mode": "text",
    "text": "Hello World"
}})
```

## ✨ Features

### 🌀 Automatic Downcasts

Let's say you have the following logger:

```python
FeatureNewPage = Literal["newline"]

class LoggerBase(PluginModel):
    def log_line(self, line: str, new_page: bool=False): ...

class LoggerStdout(LoggerBase, value="stdout"):
    new_page_token: str|None = None
    def log_line(self, line: str, new_page: bool=False):
        if new_page:
            if not self.new_page_token:
                raise ValueError("new_page_token is not set")
            print(self.new_page_token)
        print(line)

class Component1(BaseModel):
    logger: LoggerBase

class Component2(BaseModel):
    logger: LoggerBase[FeatureNewPage]
```

then users could not use `Component2` with `LoggerStdout` as it does not support the `FeatureNewPage` feature, even thoudh `LoggerStdout` would support it, if `new_page_token: str` was enforced.

Conventionally, this would require the developer to create two classes (i.e. `LoggerStdout` and `LoggerStdoutNewPage`) and then include either one in the final annotated union depending on if the component requires the new page functionality.

With `plugantic`, you can automatically create subtypes that are more strict than the base type and they will be automatically validated and downcast when using the model:

```python
def ensure_new_page_feature(handler: PluginDowncastHandler):
    handler.enable_feature(FeatureNewPage)
    handler.set_field_annotation("new_page_token", str)
    handler.remove_field_default("new_page_token")

class LoggerBase(PluginModel, value="stdout", auto_downcasts=(ensure_new_page_feature,)):
    new_page_token: str|None = None
    def log_line(self, line: str, new_page: bool=False):
        if new_page:
            if not self.new_page_token:
                raise ValueError("new_page_token is not set")
            print(self.new_page_token)
        print(line)
```

By declaring multiple callbacks in `auto_downcasts`, you can create a superset of all possible downcasts and `plugantic` will automatically select the least strict depending on which features you require.


### 🔌 Extensibility

You can add new plugins after the fact!

To do so, you will have to ensure one of the following prerequisites:

**1. Use `ForwardRef`s**

```python
from __future__ import annotations # either by importing annotations from the __future__ package

class BaseConfig(PluginModel):
    ...

...

class CommonConfig1(BaseModel):
    config: BaseConfig

class CommonConfig2(BaseModel):
    config: "BaseConfig" # or by using a string as the type annotation


class NumberConfig(BaseConfig): # now you can declare new types after the fact (but before using/validating the models)!
    ...
```

**2. Enable `defer_build`**

```python
class BaseConfig(PluginModel):
    ...

class CommonConfig(BaseModel):
    config: BaseConfig

    model_config = {"defer_build": True}
```

### 📝 Type Checker Friendliness

The type checker can infer the type of the plugin model, so you don't need to define a union type or a discriminator field!
Everything except for the annotated union is based on pydantic and as such can be used like before as type checkers are already familiar with pydantic.

## 🏛️ Leading Principles

### Composition over Inheritance

Composition is preferred over inheritance.

### Dont repeat yourself (DRY)

Having to inherit from a base class just to then declare an annotated union or having to declare a discriminator field both as an annotation and with a default being the same as the annotation is a violation of the DRY principle. This library tackles all of these issues at once.

### Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you accept

Using automatic downcasts, this library allows developers to accept every possible value when validating a model.


## 💻 Development

### 📁 Code structure

The code is structured as follows:

- `src/plugantic/` contains the source code
- `tests/` contains the tests

Most of the actual logic is in the `src/plugantic/plugin.py` file.

### 📦 Distribution

To build the package, you can do the following:

```bash
uv run build
```
    
<details>
<summary>Publishing</summary>

> 💡 This section is primarily relevant for the maintainers of this package (me), as it requires permission to push a package to the `plugantic` repository on PyPI.

```bash
uv run publish --token <token>
```

</details>

### 🎯 Tests

To run all tests, you can do the following:

```bash
uv run pytest
```
