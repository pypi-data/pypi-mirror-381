## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-02

### 🎯 New Features
- **Added `is_hidden` field to WorkFlow, Pipeline, and Stage models**:
  - Main workflows, pipelines, and stages have `is_hidden=False` by default
  - Cloned workflows, pipelines, and stages automatically have `is_hidden=True`

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-01

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fixed build_approval_steps conflict**: Resolved "cannot have both 'assigned_to' and 'assigned_role'" error
  - Removed initialization of `assigned_to` and `role_selection_strategy` in base step dictionary
  - Now only relevant keys are added based on approval type (user-based OR role-based)
  - Prevents approval workflow package from rejecting steps with conflicting keys
  - This was causing workflow start failures for role-based approvals

### 🎯 Enhanced User Handling
- **Robust approval_user processing**: Now handles multiple input formats seamlessly
  - Supports integer user IDs: `approval_user: 123`
  - Supports dict format with "val" key: `approval_user: {"val": 123}`
  - Supports direct User objects: `approval_user: user_instance`
  - Automatic fallback to `created_by_user` when user not found
  - Error logging for debugging when user lookup fails
  - Consistent User object output regardless of input format

### 🎯 Code Quality Improvements
- **Replaced all hardcoded strings with enum constants**:
  - `ApprovalTypes.ROLE`, `ApprovalTypes.USER`, `ApprovalTypes.SELF` instead of strings
  - `RoleSelectionStrategy.ROUND_ROBIN`, `RoleSelectionStrategy.ANYONE`, `RoleSelectionStrategy.CONSENSUS` instead of strings
  - Updated README examples to use enum constants
  - Updated all test files to use enum constants
  - Better type safety and IDE support
- **Fixed type hint warnings**:
  - Resolved "Expected type 'int | dict[str, Any]'" warning for role_selection_strategy
  - Changed from `.get()` with default to explicit None check for better type safety
  - Cleaner code that satisfies static type checkers

### ⚙️ Dynamic Validation
- **Validation now uses enum choices dynamically**:
  - `valid_approval_types` generated from `ApprovalTypes.choices`
  - `valid_strategies` generated from `RoleSelectionStrategy.choices`
  - Automatically stays in sync with enum definitions
  - Removed hardcoded validation lists

### 📚 Documentation Enhancements
- **Added comprehensive Approval Package setup guide in README**:
  - Step-by-step model configuration instructions
  - Three implementation options (Django Group, Custom Role, Dynamic Forms)
  - Complete settings examples with best practices
  - Proper placement in Quick Start guide for better discoverability

### ✅ Testing
- **Added 3 new test cases for build_approval_steps**:
  - `test_build_approval_steps_role_based_no_assigned_to_conflict`: Verifies role-based approvals don't have `assigned_to`
  - `test_build_approval_steps_user_based_no_role_conflict`: Verifies user-based approvals don't have `assigned_role`
  - `test_build_approval_steps_mixed_approvals_no_conflicts`: Verifies mixed approval types work correctly
- **Updated stage configuration examples in README**:
  - Added `name_en`, `name_ar`, `pipeline_id` as stage-level fields
  - Clarified distinction between Stage model fields and `stage_info` JSON configuration
- **All 150 tests passing**: Full test coverage maintained

### 📋 Technical Details
- **Backward compatible**: No breaking changes to existing API

## [1.0.9] - 2025-10-01

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed department_generic_fk setting**: `create_pipeline` now correctly sets department generic foreign key
  - Fixed `set_pipeline_department` to use lowercase model name for ContentType lookup
  - ContentType model field is always stored in lowercase in Django
  - Previously failed silently when department_id was provided

### ⚙️ Configuration
- **Added DJANGO_WORKFLOW_ENGINE settings**: Proper configuration support for department model mapping
  - Added `DEPARTMENT_MODEL` setting in sandbox/settings.py for testing
  - Ensures department mapping works correctly across different environments

### ✅ Testing
- **Added comprehensive test coverage for pipeline department functionality**:
  - `test_create_pipeline_with_department`: Verifies department_generic_fk is set correctly when department_id is provided
  - `test_create_pipeline_without_department`: Ensures pipeline creation works without department_id
  - `test_set_pipeline_department`: Validates set_pipeline_department function directly
- **All 18 service tests passing**: Complete test coverage for department-related functionality

### 📋 Technical Details
- **Backward compatible**: No breaking changes to existing API
- **Bug fix only**: Resolves issue where department was not being set when using create_pipeline service
- **Better error handling**: Silent failures now properly addressed with correct ContentType lookup
