## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-01

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fixed build_approval_steps conflict**: Resolved "cannot have both 'assigned_to' and 'assigned_role'" error
  - Removed initialization of `assigned_to` and `role_selection_strategy` in base step dictionary
  - Now only relevant keys are added based on approval type (user-based OR role-based)
  - Prevents approval workflow package from rejecting steps with conflicting keys
  - This was causing workflow start failures for role-based approvals

### üéØ Enhanced User Handling
- **Robust approval_user processing**: Now handles multiple input formats seamlessly
  - Supports integer user IDs: `approval_user: 123`
  - Supports dict format with "val" key: `approval_user: {"val": 123}`
  - Supports direct User objects: `approval_user: user_instance`
  - Automatic fallback to `created_by_user` when user not found
  - Error logging for debugging when user lookup fails
  - Consistent User object output regardless of input format

### üéØ Code Quality Improvements
- **Replaced all hardcoded strings with enum constants**:
  - `ApprovalTypes.ROLE`, `ApprovalTypes.USER`, `ApprovalTypes.SELF` instead of strings
  - `RoleSelectionStrategy.ROUND_ROBIN`, `RoleSelectionStrategy.ANYONE`, `RoleSelectionStrategy.CONSENSUS` instead of strings
  - Updated README examples to use enum constants
  - Updated all test files to use enum constants
  - Better type safety and IDE support
- **Fixed type hint warnings**:
  - Resolved "Expected type 'int | dict[str, Any]'" warning for role_selection_strategy
  - Changed from `.get()` with default to explicit None check for better type safety
  - Cleaner code that satisfies static type checkers

### ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Validation
- **Validation now uses enum choices dynamically**:
  - `valid_approval_types` generated from `ApprovalTypes.choices`
  - `valid_strategies` generated from `RoleSelectionStrategy.choices`

  - `test_build_approval_steps_user_based_no_role_conflict`: Verifies user-based approvals don't have `assigned_role`
  - `test_build_approval_steps_mixed_approvals_no_conflicts`: Verifies mixed approval types work correctly
- **Updated stage configuration examples in README**:
  - Added `name_en`, `name_ar`, `pipeline_id` as stage-level fields
  - Clarified distinction between Stage model fields and `stage_info` JSON configuration
- **All 150 tests passing**: Full test coverage maintained

### üìã Technical Details
