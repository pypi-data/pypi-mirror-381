    Sample a model given the dependency matrix of a
    fixed size. The terms are sampled using Markov-chain Monte-carlo.

    First a random model is sampled by adding terms one-by-one. Next,
    that sample is mutated for `n_warmup` times. Finally, a chain 
    is built by mutating the sample and extracting every `skip` th sample
    until `n_samples` are generated.

    This is exactly the same method SAMS uses to sample and mutate the models,

    samples are skipped.

    ----------
    dep : np.array(2d)
        The dependency matrix of size (N, N) with N the number

    size : int

    n_samples : int
        The number of samples to draw.
    forced : np.array(1d)
        A model which must be included at all times.
    mode : None or 'weak' or 'strong'
        The heredity mode during sampling.
    skip : int
        Take every `skip` th sample from the Markov-chain.
    n_warmup : int
