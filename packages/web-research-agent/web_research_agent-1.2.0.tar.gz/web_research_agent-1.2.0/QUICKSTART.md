# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with the Web Research Agent in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Gemini API key (free from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))
- Serper API key (free tier from [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev))

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API keys:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key
SERPER_API_KEY=your_actual_serper_api_key
```

### 3. Verify Setup

Run the setup checker:

```bash
python check_setup.py
```

All checks should pass (‚úì).

### 4. Run a Simple Test

Test with simple questions:

```bash
python main.py example_simple.txt
```

This will answer basic questions and save results to `results.txt`.

### 5. Run Real Tasks

Process the full task set:

```bash
python main.py tasks.txt
```

## Understanding the Output

### Console Output
- Shows the agent's reasoning process (Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation)
- Displays the final answer for each task

### Results File (`results.txt`)
- Contains all task descriptions
- Complete answers with sources
- Execution time and step count

### Log Files (`logs/`)
- Detailed execution traces
- Useful for debugging
- Timestamped for each run

## Example: How the Agent Works

Given the task: "Find the capital of France"

```
Thought: I need to search for the capital of France
Action: search
Action Input: {"query": "capital of France"}
Observation: [Search results show Paris is the capital]

Thought: I have found the answer from reliable sources
Final Answer: The capital of France is Paris.
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "GEMINI_API_KEY not set"
- Check that `.env` file exists
- Ensure the key doesn't have quotes around it
- Verify the key is valid from Google AI Studio

### "SERPER_API_KEY not set"
- Sign up at serper.dev (free tier available)
- Copy the API key to your `.env` file

### "Module not found" errors
- Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure you're in the correct directory

### Tasks timeout before completion
- Increase `MAX_ITERATIONS` in `.env` (e.g., 20 or 25)
- Complex tasks may need more reasoning steps

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Clear Tasks**: Write specific, well-defined tasks
2. **Be Patient**: Complex research takes time (2-10 minutes per task)
3. **Check Logs**: If something fails, check `logs/` for details
4. **Adjust Settings**: Tune `.env` parameters for your needs

## What Can the Agent Do?

‚úì Search the web for current information  
‚úì Read and extract content from web pages  
‚úì Download and analyze datasets  
‚úì Perform calculations and data processing  
‚úì Compile information from multiple sources  
‚úì Provide citations and sources  

## Next Steps

- Read the full [README.md](README.md) for detailed documentation
- Modify `tasks.txt` with your own research questions
- Add custom tools by following the guide in README.md
- Experiment with different model settings in `.env`

## Need Help?

1. Run `python check_setup.py` to verify configuration
2. Check log files in `logs/` directory
3. Use `-v` flag for verbose output: `python main.py tasks.txt -v`
4. Review the [README.md](README.md) for troubleshooting
