## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**available** | **bool** | Available tracks whether or not the model passed validation. | [optional] 
**bundle** | **str** | Bundle tracks the name of the store containing this object. This field is read-only, and cannot be changed via the API. | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | CreatedAt is the time that this object was created. | [optional] 
**created_by** | **str** | CreatedBy stores the value of the user that created this object. Note: This value is stored ONLY if the object was created by a user which means that &#x60;currentUserName&#x60; needs to be populated in the authBlob | [optional] 
**description** | **str** | Description is a string for providing a simple description | [optional] 
**documentation** | **str** | Documentation is a string for providing additional in depth information. | [optional] 
**endpoint** | **str** | Endpoint tracks the owner of the object among DRP endpoints | [optional] 
**errors** | **list[str]** | If there are any errors in the validation process, they will be available here. | [optional] 
**last_modified_at** | **datetime** | LastModifiedAt is the time that this object was last modified. | [optional] 
**last_modified_by** | **str** | LastModifiedBy stores the value of the user that last modified this object. NOTE: This value is populated ONLY if the object was modified by a user which means any actions done using machine tokens will not get tracked | [optional] 
**meta** | [**Meta**](Meta.md) |  | [optional] 
**name** | **str** | Name is the key of this particular Blueprint. | 
**params** | **dict(str, object)** | Params holds the values of parameters on the object.  The field is a key / value store of the parameters. The key is the name of a parameter.  The key is of type string. The value is the value of the parameter.  The type of the value is defined by the parameter object.  If the key doesn&#39;t reference a parameter, the type of the object can be anything.  The system will enforce the named parameter&#39;s value&#39;s type.  Go calls the \&quot;anything\&quot; parameters as \&quot;interface {}\&quot;.  Hence, the type of this field is a map[string]interface{}. | [optional] 
**profiles** | **list[str]** | Profiles is an array of profiles to apply to this object in order when looking for a parameter during rendering. | [optional] 
**read_only** | **bool** | ReadOnly tracks if the store for this object is read-only. This flag is informational, and cannot be changed via the API. | [optional] 
**tasks** | **list[str]** | Tasks is a list of strings that match the same as the machine&#39;s Task list. Actions, contexts, and stages are allowed, provided that the bootenv does not change. | [optional] 
**validated** | **bool** | Validated tracks whether or not the model has been validated. | [optional]
