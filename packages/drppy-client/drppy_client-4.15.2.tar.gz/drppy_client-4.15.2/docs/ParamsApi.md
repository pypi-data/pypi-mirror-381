Lists Params filtered by some parameters.

This will show all Params by default.  You may specify to control the search:  aggregate = boolean to indicate if the parameters should be aggregated for search and return<br/> expand = boolean to indicate if the parameters should be expanded for search and return<br/> filter = a string that defines a Named filter<br/> raw = a string that is template expanded and then parsed for filter functions<br/>  You may specify to control the output:  decode = boolean to indicate that the returned object have the secure parameters decoded.<br/> group-by = can be specified multiple times. An array of objects (nested) grouped by the value is returned.<br/> limit = integer, number of items to return<br/> offset = integer, 0-based inclusive starting point in filter data.<br/> params = a comma separated list of parameters, or list functions to allow for inclusion in the returned object (if appropriate)<br/> range-only = returns only counts of the objects in the groups.<br/> reverse = boolean to indicate to reverse the returned list<br/> slim = A comma separated list of fields to exclude (meta, params, or other field names)<br/> sort = A list of strings defining the fields or parameters to sort by<br/> reduced = boolean to indicate that the objects should not have read-only fields<br/> commented = boolean to indicate that field comments should be included in object<br/>  Functions:  Eq(value) = Return items that are equal to value<br/> Lt(value) = Return items that are less than value<br/> Lte(value) = Return items that less than or equal to value<br/> Gt(value) = Return items that are greater than value<br/> Gte(value) = Return items that greater than or equal to value<br/> Between(lower,upper) = Return items that are inclusively between lower and upper<br/> Except(lower,upper) = Return items that are not inclusively between lower and upper<br/>  Functions can be applied against fields of the object.  Example:  Name=fred - returns items named fred<br/> Name=Lt(fred) - returns items that alphabetically less than fred.<br/> Name=Lt(fred)&Available=true - returns items with Name less than fred and Available is true<br/>

 **created_at** | **str**| CreatedAt is the time that this object was created. | [optional] 
 **created_by** | **str**| CreatedBy stores the value of the user that created this object. Note: This value is stored ONLY if the object was created by a user which means that &#x60;currentUserName&#x60; needs to be populated in the authBlob | [optional]

 **meta** | **str**| Meta contains the meta data of the object.  The type of this field is a key / value map/dictionary. The key type is string. The value type is also string.  The general content of the field is undefined and can be an arbritary store. There are some common known keys:  color - The color the UX uses when displaying icon - The icon the UX uses when displaying title - The UX uses this for additional display information.  Often the source of the object.  Specific Object types use additional meta data fields.  These are described at: https://docs.rackn.io/stable/redirect/?ref&#x3D;rs_object_metadata | [optional] 
 **name** | **str**| Name is the name of the param.  Params must be uniquely named. | [optional]
