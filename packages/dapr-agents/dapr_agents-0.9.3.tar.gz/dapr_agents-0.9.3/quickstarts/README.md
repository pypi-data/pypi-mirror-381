### LLM Call with Dapr Chat Client

Learn how to interact with Language Models using Dapr Agents' `DaprChatClient`:

- **Text Completion**: Generating responses to prompts
- **Swapping LLM providers**: switching LLM backends without application code change
- **Resilience**: Setting timeout, retry and circuit-breaking
- **PII Obfuscation** â€“ Automatically detect and mask sensitive user information.


This quickstart shows basic text generation using plain text prompts and templates. Using the `DaprChatClient` you can target different LLM providers without changing your agent's code.

### LLM Call with OpenAI Client

Learn how to interact with Language Models using Dapr Agents and native LLM client libraries.

- **Text Completion**: Generating responses to prompts
- **Structured Outputs**: Converting LLM responses to Pydantic objects

This quickstart shows both basic text generation and structured data extraction from LLMs. This quickstart uses the OpenAIChatClient which allows you to use audio and perform embeddings in addition to chat completion. 

*Note: Other quickstarts for specific clients are available for [Elevenlabs](./02_llm_call_elevenlabs), [Hugging Face](./02_llm_call_hugging_face), and [Nvidia](./02_llm_call_nvidia).*

- **Tool Definition**: Creating reusable tools with the @tool decorator
- **Agent Configuration**: Setting up agents with roles, goals, and tools
- **Tool Definition**: Custom tools with the @tool decorator
- **Function Calling**: Enabling LLMs to execute Python functions

This quickstart demonstrates how to build a weather assistant that can fetch information and perform actions.

### Durable Agent Tool Call (with Dapr Workflows)

Create a stateful AI agent using Dapr Agents' DurableAgent and Dapr workflows:

* **Durable Agent**: Maintains state across runs for reliable, long-running tasks
* **Workflow Integration**: Uses Dapr workflows for persistence and recovery
* **Tool Definition**: Custom tools with the @tool decorator
* **Function Calling**: LLM-powered Python function execution

This quickstart demonstrates how to build a weather assistant with durable, workflow-enabled capabilities.

### LLM-based Workflow Patterns

Learn to orchestrate stateful, resilient workflows powered by Language Models (LLMs) using Dapr Agents:

- **LLM-powered Tasks**: Automate reasoning and decision-making in workflows
- **Task Chaining**: Build multi-step processes with reliable state management
- **Fan-out/Fan-in**: Execute activities in parallel and synchronize results for robust automation

This quickstart demonstrates how to design and run sequential and parallel workflows using Dapr Agents and LLMs for advanced orchestration.

### Multi-Agent Workflows

Advanced example of event-driven workflows with multiple autonomous agents:

- **Multi-agent Systems**: Creating a network of specialized agents
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Implementing pub/sub messaging between agents
- **Actor Model**: Using Dapr Actors for stateful agent management
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinating agents through different selection strategies

This quickstart demonstrates a Lord of the Rings themed multi-agent system where agents collaborate to solve problems.

### Conversational Document Agent with Chainlit

Build a fully functional, agent that parses unstructured documents, learns them, and enables users to chat over their contents with persistent conversational memory. Integrates Dapr with Chainlit for a ready-to-use chat UI.

- **Converse With Unstructured Data**: Upload documents, parse, contextualize, and chat with them
- **Conversational Memory**: Agent maintains context across interactions in your database of choice
- **UI Interface**: Out-of-the-box, LLM-ready chat interface using Chainlit
- **Cloud Agnostic**: File uploads handled by Dapr, configurable for different backends
