              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

Dapr Agents is a developer framework designed to build production-grade resilient AI agent systems that operate at scale. Built on top of the battle-tested Dapr project, it enables software developers to create AI agents that reason, act, and collaborate using Large Language Models (LLMs), while leveraging built-in observability and stateful workflow execution to guarantee agentic workflows complete successfully, no matter how complex.

![](./docs/img/logo-workflows.png)

## Key Features

- **Scale and Efficiency**: Run thousands of agents efficiently on a single core. Dapr distributes single and multi-agent apps transparently across fleets of machines and handles their lifecycle.
- **Workflow Resilience**: Automatically retries agentic workflows and ensures task completion.
- **Kubernetes-Native**: Easily deploy and manage agents in Kubernetes environments.
- **Data-Driven Agents**: Directly integrate with databases, documents, and unstructured data by connecting to dozens of different data sources.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Secure and observable by default, enabling collaboration between agents.
- **Vendor-Neutral & Open Source**: Avoid vendor lock-in and gain flexibility across cloud and on-premises deployments.
- **Platform-Ready**: Built-in RBAC, access scopes and declarative resources enable platform teams to integrate Dapr agents into their systems. 

## Why Choose Dapr Agents?

### Scalable Workflows as a First Class Citizen

Dapr Agents uses a [durable-execution workflow engine](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-overview/) that guarantees each agent task executes to completion in the face of network interruptions, node crashes and other types of disruptive failures. Developers do not need to know about the underlying concepts of the workflow engine - simply write an agent that performs any number of tasks and these will get automatically distributed across the cluster. If any task fails, it will be retried and recover its state from where it left off.

### Cost-Effective AI Adoption

Dapr Agents builds on top of Dapr's Workflow API, which under the hood represents each agent as an actor, a single unit of compute and state that is thread-safe and natively distributed, lending itself well to an agentic Scale-To-Zero architecture. This minimizes infrastructure costs, making AI adoption accessible to everyone. The underlying virtual actor model allows thousands of agents to run on demand on a single core machine with double-digit millisecond latency when scaling from zero. When unused, the agents are reclaimed by the system but retain their state until the next time they are needed. With this design, there's no trade-off between performance and resource efficiency.

### Data-Centric AI Agents

With built-in connectivity to over 50 enterprise data sources, Dapr Agents efficiently handles structured and unstructured data. From basic [PDF extraction](https://v1-16.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/dapr-agents/dapr-agents-integrations/#arxiv-fetcher) to large-scale database interactions, it enables seamless data-driven AI workflows with minimal code changes. Dapr's [bindings](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/) and [state stores](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-state-stores/) provide access to a large number of data sources that can be used to ingest data to an agent.

### Accelerated Development

Dapr Agents provides a set of AI features that give developers a complete API surface to tackle common problems. Some of these include:

- Multi-agent communications
- Structured outputs
- Multiple LLM providers
- Contextual memory
- Flexible prompting
- Intelligent tool selection
- [MCP integration](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp).

### Integrated Security and Reliability

By building on top of Dapr, platform and infrastructure teams can apply Dapr's [resiliency policies](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/resiliency-overview/) to the database and/or message broker of their choice that are used by Dapr Agents. These policies include timeouts, retry/backoffs and circuit breakers. When it comes to security, Dapr provides the option to scope access to a given database or message broker to one or more agentic app deployments. In addition, Dapr Agents uses mTLS to encrypt the communication layer of its underlying components. 

### Built-in Messaging and State Infrastructure

* 🎯 **Service-to-Service Invocation**: Facilitates direct communication between agents with built-in service discovery, error handling, and distributed tracing. Agents can leverage this for synchronous messaging in multi-agent workflows.
* ⚡️ **Publish and Subscribe**: Supports loosely coupled collaboration between agents through a shared message bus. This enables real-time, event-driven interactions critical for task distribution and coordination.
* 🔄 **Durable Workflow**: Defines long-running, persistent workflows that combine deterministic processes with LLM-based decision-making. Dapr Agents uses this to orchestrate complex multi-step agentic workflows seamlessly.
* 🧠 **State Management**: Provides a flexible key-value store for agents to retain context across interactions, ensuring continuity and adaptability during workflows.
* 🤖 **Actors**: Implements the Virtual Actor pattern, allowing agents to operate as self-contained, stateful units that handle messages sequentially. This eliminates concurrency concerns and enhances scalability in agentic systems.

### Vendor-Neutral and Open Source

As a part of **CNCF**, Dapr Agents is vendor-neutral, eliminating concerns about lock-in, intellectual property risks, or proprietary restrictions. Organizations gain full flexibility and control over their AI applications using open-source software they can audit and contribute to.

## Roadmap

Here are some of the major features we're working on:
