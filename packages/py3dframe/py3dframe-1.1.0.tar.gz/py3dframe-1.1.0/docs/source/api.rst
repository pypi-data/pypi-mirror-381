API Reference
==============

The package ``py3dframe`` is composed of the following main classes:

- :class:`py3dframe.Rotation` class is used to manage 3D rotations (alias of ``scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation``).
- :class:`py3dframe.Frame` class is used to represent 3D frames of reference.
- :class:`py3dframe.FrameTransform` class is used to manage 3D transformations between frames.

Some additional utility functions are also provided in the :mod:`py3dframe.matrix` module in order to manipulate 3D matrices in :math:`O(3)` and :math:`SO(3)` groups:

   ./api_doc/is_SO3.rst
   ./api_doc/O3_project.rst
   ./api_doc/SO3_project.rst

Finally, to perform conversions between the different conventions used in the literature for representing 3D rotations and transformations, a function :func:`py3dframe.switch_RT_convention` is provided:
