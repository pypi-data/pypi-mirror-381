"""Experimental integration of msiflow preprocessing steps to split off background from tissue images for nanoDESI imaging. All credit
for this workflow should be directed to https://github.com/Immunodynamics-Engel-Lab/msiflow, I've only made minor changes here for compatibility
with a python package rather than a snakefile (only marginally breaking the spirit of their standardization work)"""
