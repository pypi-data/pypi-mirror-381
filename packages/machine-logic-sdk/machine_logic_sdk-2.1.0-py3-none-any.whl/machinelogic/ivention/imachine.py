    various components using the friendly names that you've defined in your MachineLogic
    configuration.

    To create a new Machine with default settings, you can simply write:
        machine = Machine()

    If you need to connect to services running on a different machine or IP address,
    you can specify the IP address as follows:
        machine = Machine("192.168.7.2")
