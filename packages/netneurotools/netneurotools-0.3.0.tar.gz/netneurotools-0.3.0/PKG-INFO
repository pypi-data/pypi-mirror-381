This toolbox is a collection of functions written in Python that get frequent
usage in the `Network Neuroscience Lab <https://netneurolab.github.io/>`_, housed in
the `Brain Imaging Centre <https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/home>`_ at
`McGill University <https://www.mcgill.ca/>`_.

for more information!


.. _installation:

Installation
------------

You can install directly from PyPi with :code:`pip install netneurotools`.

This package is under active development. We recommend installing the latest version
with 

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/netneurolab/netneurotools.git


If you are looking for the earlier version of the toolbox before the recent breaking changes,
you can install it with

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/netneurolab/netneurotools.git@0.2.X


.. _development:

Development
-----------

This package has been developed by members of the Network Neuroscience Lab in
pursuit of their research. While we've made every effort to ensure these tools
work and have some documentation, there is always room for improvement! If
you've found a bug, are experiencing a problem, or have a question, create a
new `issue <https://github.com/netneurolab/netneurotools/issues>`_ with some
information about it and one of our team members will do our best to help you.
