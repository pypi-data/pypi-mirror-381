## `panoramax_cli upload`

Uploads some files.

Upload some files to a Panoramax instance. The files will be associated to one or many sequences.

**Usage**:

```console
$ panoramax_cli upload [OPTIONS] PATH
```

**Arguments**:

* `PATH`: Local path to your sequence folder  [required]

**Options**:

* `--api-url TEXT`: Panoramax endpoint URL  [required]
* `--wait / --no-wait`: Wait for all pictures to be ready  [default: no-wait]
* `--is-blurred / --is-not-blurred`: Define if sequence is already blurred or not  [default: is-not-blurred]
* `--title TEXT`: Collection title. If not provided, the title will be the directory name.
* `--token TEXT`: Panoramax token if the panoramax instance needs it. If none is provided and the panoramax instance requires it, the token will be asked during run. Note: is is advised to wait for prompt without using this variable.
* `--sort-method [filename-asc|filename-desc|time-asc|time-desc]`: Strategy used for sorting your pictures. Either by filename or EXIF time, in ascending or descending order.  [default: time-asc]
* `--split-distance INTEGER`: Maximum distance between two pictures to be considered in the same sequence (in meters). If not provided, the instance&#x27;s default value will be used. Splitting can be disabled entirely with --no-split.
* `--split-time INTEGER`: Maximum time interval between two pictures to be considered in the same sequence (in seconds). If not provided, the instance&#x27;s default value will be used. Splitting can be disabled entirely with --no-split.
* `--no-split / --split`: If True, all pictures of this upload will be grouped in the same sequence. Is incompatible with split_distance / split_time.  [default: split]
* `--duplicate-distance FLOAT`: Maximum distance between two pictures to be considered as duplicates (in meters). If not provided, the instance&#x27;s default value will be used. Deduplication can be disabled entirely with --no-deduplication.
* `--duplicate-rotation INTEGER`: Maximum angle of rotation for two too-close-pictures to be considered as duplicates (in degrees). If not provided, the instance&#x27;s default value will be used. Deduplication can be disabled entirely with --no-deduplication.
* `--no-deduplication / --deduplication`: If True, no duplication will be done. Is incompatible with duplicate_distance / duplicate_rotation.  [default: deduplication]
* `--relative-heading INTEGER`: The relative heading (in degrees), offset based on movement path (0° = looking forward, -90° = looking left, 90° = looking right). For single picture upload_sets, 0° is heading north). For example, use 90° if the camera was mounted on the vehicle facing right. If not set, the headings are either retreived using the pictures metadata or computed using the movement path if no metadata is set.
* `--picture-upload-timeout FLOAT`: Timeout time to receive the first byte of the response for each picture upload (in seconds)  [default: 60.0]
* `--parallel-uploads INTEGER`: Amount of pictures to send in parallel  [default: 1]

* `--disable-duplicates-check / --enable-duplicates-check`: Disable locally checking for pictures duplicates (almost same time and coordinates).
Disabling this avoids long local processing (duplicates are checked on server-side), enabling avoids sending useless pictures to server.
Choose depending on if your Internet is faster than your hard drive.  [default: enable-duplicates-check]
* `--disable-cert-check / --enable-cert-check`: Disable SSL certificates checks while uploading. This should not be used unless you __really__ know what you are doing.  [default: enable-cert-check]
* `--help`: Show this message and exit.
