# Shredword

A fast and efficient tokenizer library for natural language processing tasks, built with Python and optimized C backend.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Fast tokenization powered by optimized C libraries
- **Multiple Encodings**: Support for various tokenization models and vocabularies
- **Flexible API**: Easy-to-use Python interface with comprehensive functionality
- **Special Tokens**: Built-in support for special tokens and custom vocabularies
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Robust error handling with fallback tokenization
- **BPE Support**: Byte Pair Encoding implementation for subword tokenization

## Installation

```bash
pip install shredword
```

## Quick Start

```python
from shred import load_encoding

# Load a tokenizer
tokenizer = load_encoding("pre_16k")

# Encode text to tokens
tokens = tokenizer.encode("Hello, world!")
print(tokens)  # [10478, 10408, 10416, 10416, ...

# Decode tokens back to text
text = tokenizer.decode(tokens)
print(text)  # "Hello, world!"

# Get vocabulary information
print(f"Vocabulary size: {tokenizer.vocab_size}")
print(f"Special tokens: {tokenizer.special_tokens}")
```

## Documentation
