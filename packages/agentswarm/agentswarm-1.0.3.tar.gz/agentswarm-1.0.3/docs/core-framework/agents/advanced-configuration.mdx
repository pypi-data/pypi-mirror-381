All parameters inside the `Agent` class follow the same structure as the OpenAI Agents SDK [`Agent`](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/agent/#agents.agent.Agent). However, there are a few advanced parameters that require more explanation.

### Parallel Tool Calls

Controls whether tools execute in parallel or sequentially for a given agent.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent, ModelSettings

agent = Agent(
    name="MyAgent",
    instructions="...",
    model_settings=ModelSettings(parallel_tool_calls=False),
)
```

To force sequential execution for a specific tool regardless of that setting, set `one_call_at_a_time = True` in the tool’s `ToolConfig`. See [Advanced Tool Configuration](/core-framework/tools/custom-tools/configuration).

### File Search

If your `files_folder` ends with `_vs_<vector_store_id>`, Agency Swarm automatically associates files with that Vector Store and adds `FileSearchTool` to the Agent. The `include_search_results` behavior can be toggled via the Agent’s `include_search_results` flag.

### Output Validation

Use `output_guardrails` on the `Agent` to validate outputs. See the detailed guide: [Input and Output Validation](/additional-features/input-output-validation).    
For a complete working example, see: [examples/response_validation.py](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm/blob/main/examples/response_validation.py).

### Few‑Shot Examples

Few‑shot examples are supported and appended to `instructions` at initialization. The format follows the [message object format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/messages/createMessage).

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent

examples = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"},
]

agent = Agent(name="MyAgent", examples=examples)
```
