Agency in Agency Swarm is a collection of agents that can collaborate with one another.

## Benefits of Using an Agency

Utilizing an Agency consisting of multiple agents offers several benefits:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Fewer Hallucinations" icon="bug" iconType="solid">
  Agents within an agency can supervise each other, reducing mistakes and handling unexpected scenarios more effectively.
</Card>

<Card title="Complex Tasks" icon="diagram-project" iconType="solid">
  Adding more agents allows for longer sequences of actions, enabling the completion of more complex tasks before delivering results to the user.
</Card>

<Card title="Scalability" icon="arrow-up-right-dots" iconType="solid">
  Agencies allow you to scale your solutions seamlessly by adding more agents, as the complexity of your system grows.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Start with a minimal number of agents. Fine-tune them to ensure they function correctly before adding more.
  Introducing too many agents initially can make debugging and understanding interactions challenging.
</Tip>

In the latest version, the Agency class orchestrates a collection of `Agent` instances based on a defined structure. It provides enhanced thread management, persistence hooks, and improved communication patterns between agents.

## Agency Parameters

Overview of parameters in the new `Agency` class:

| Name | Parameter | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Entry Points | `*entry_points_args` | Positional arguments representing Agent instances that serve as entry points for external interaction. These agents can be directly messaged by users. |
| Communication Flows *(optional)* | `communication_flows` | List of (sender, receiver) tuples defining allowed agent-to-agent message paths. Example: `[(ceo, dev), (ceo, va)]`. Default: `None` |
| Name *(optional)* | `name` | A name for the agency instance. Default: `None` |
| Shared Instructions *(optional)* | `shared_instructions` | Instructions prepended to all agents' system prompts in a string format or a path to markdown file. Default: `None` |
| Send Message Tool Class *(optional)* | `send_message_tool_class` | Custom SendMessage tool class to use for all agents that don't have their own send_message_tool_class set. Enables enhanced inter-agent communication patterns. Default: `None` |
| Load Threads Callback *(optional)* | `load_threads_callback` | A callable to load conversation threads for persistence. Default: `None` |
| Save Threads Callback *(optional)* | `save_threads_callback` | A callable to save conversation threads for persistence. Default: `None` |
| User Context *(optional)* | `user_context` | Initial shared context accessible to all agents during runs. Default: `None` |

### Deprecated Parameters

The following parameters are deprecated and will issue warnings:

- `agency_chart` - Use positional entry points and `communication_flows` instead
- `shared_files` - Shared file handling is not currently implemented
- `async_mode` - Asynchronous execution is handled by the underlying SDK
- `settings_path` & `settings_callbacks` - Responses SDK is now stateless, so agency settings are no longer needed.
- `threads_callbacks` - Use `load_threads_callback` and `save_threads_callback` directly
- Agent-level parameters (`temperature`, `top_p`, `max_prompt_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens`, etc.) - Set these directly on each Agent.

## Example

Quick example of how to create an agency with 3 agents using the new structure:

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency
from .ceo import CEO
from .developer import Developer
from .virtual_assistant import VirtualAssistant

ceo = CEO()
dev = Developer()
va = VirtualAssistant()

# New structure: entry points as positional args, communication flows as keyword arg
agency = Agency(
    ceo, dev,  # Entry points - these agents can interact with users
    communication_flows=[
        (ceo, dev),  # CEO can initiate communication with Developer
        (ceo, va),   # CEO can initiate communication with Virtual Assistant
        (dev, va)    # Developer can initiate communication with Virtual Assistant
    ],
    shared_instructions="You are part of a collaborative agency focused on software development.",
    user_context={"project_type": "web_application"}
)
```
