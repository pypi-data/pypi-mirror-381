Agency Swarm conveniently manages the state of your agents and threads, simplifying the agent creation and management process.

## Agent State Management

With the new https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python, agents (formerly assistants) are now stateless - eliminating the need to save and pass agent settings for chat persistence. The framework only needs to maintain the conversation history, which Agency Swarm manages through its thread system.

## Thread State Management

Since managing conversation state is now a responsibility of the developer in the Agents SDK, the Agency Swarm framework has introduced a thread management system to handle, automate, and simplify history management. All agent outputs are processed and stored locally to allow for seamless agency usage within a single session. To maintain persistence across multiple sessions, the framework also provides convenient callback methods that require minimal input to set up.
