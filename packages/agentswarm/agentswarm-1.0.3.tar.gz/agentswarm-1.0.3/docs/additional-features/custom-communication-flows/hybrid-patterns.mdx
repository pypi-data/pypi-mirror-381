Agency Swarm supports two paradigms for inter-agent communication that can work together seamlessly: **SendMessage tools** (orchestrator pattern) and **OpenAI SDK Handoffs** (sequential pattern). This guide explains how these patterns interact and provides practical examples for building multi-agent systems.

    Control returns to the caller, ideal for coordination with oversight. Implemented via `SendMessage` tool variants.

  <Card title="Handoffs" icon="arrow-turn-right">
    Control transfers to the target, ideal for full task delegation and specialization. Powered by `SendMessageHandoff` + OpenAI SDK.
  </Card>
  
</CardGroup>

## Understanding the Two Paradigms

### SendMessage Tools (Orchestrator Pattern)
- **Control Flow**: Control **returns** to the calling agent
- **Use Case**: Delegation with oversight and coordination
- **Implementation**: Via `SendMessage` tool variants
- **Example**: `Orchestrator -> Worker -> Response to Orchestrator`

### Handoffs (Sequential Pattern)
- **Control Flow**: Control **transfers** to the handoff target
- **Use Case**: Complete task delegation and specialization
- **Implementation**: Via `SendMessageHandoff` tool class + OpenAI SDK
- **Example**: `Worker -> Specialist` (control stays with Specialist)

## The Hybrid Resolution

When both patterns are used together, you can use Agency Swarm to implement a **hybrid approach** that allows both to coexist without conflicts:

### How It Works

The hybrid approach works by layering the two communication patterns strategically:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Primary Communication Uses Orchestrator Pattern">
    When Agent A sends a message to Agent B using `SendMessage`, Agent B will **always** send its response back to Agent A. This ensures predictable communication flow—you always know where responses will go.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Internal Processing Can Use Handoffs">
    While Agent B is working on Agent A's request, Agent B can consult with specialist agents using handoffs. The specialist receives the full context as provided to Agent B, and Agent B aggregates insights before formulating its final response.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Best of Both Worlds">
    - Agent A gets the coordination benefits of the orchestrator pattern (responses come back)
    - Agent B gets the specialization benefits of handoffs (can consult experts)
    - The final response to Agent A includes a summary of the specialist knowledge, without needing to manage multiple conversations
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up Handoffs

In this framework, handoffs are configured via the `SendMessageHandoff` tool.

```python agency_setup.py
from agency_swarm import Agency, Agent
from agency_swarm.tools import SendMessageHandoff

# Create specialized agents
orchestrator = Agent(
    name="ProjectManager",
    instructions="Coordinate project tasks and oversee completion",
    # ... other config
)

worker = Agent(
    name="Developer",
    instructions="Handle development tasks, consult specialists when needed",
    send_message_tool_class=SendMessageHandoff,
    # ... other config
)

specialist = Agent(
    name="SecurityExpert",
    instructions="Provide security expertise and recommendations",
    # Agent description will be added to the handoff tool instructions
    description="Provides security expertise and recommendations",
    # ... other config
)

# Create agency with communication flows
agency = Agency(
    orchestrator,
    communication_flows=[
        (orchestrator, worker),      # Creates send_message_to_Developer tool
        (orchestrator, specialist),  # Creates send_message_to_SecurityExpert tool
        (worker, specialist),        # Creates a handoff from worker to specialist (since worker has a special send message class)
    ]
)
```

### Execution Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="ProjectManager delegates to Developer">
    ProjectManager uses `send_message_to_Developer`: "Implement user authentication with security best practices".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Developer consults a specialist">
    Developer decides to consult SecurityExpert and performs an internal handoff.
  </Step>
  <Step title="SecurityExpert advises">
    SecurityExpert provides security recommendations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Developer finalizes and responds">
    Developer incorporates the advice and responds to ProjectManager.
  </Step>
  <Step title="ProjectManager receives a comprehensive answer">
    The response includes the necessary security considerations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to Use Hybrid Patterns

### Ideal Use Cases

- **Hierarchical task delegation with oversight**: Manager needs visibility but workers need specialist consultation
- **Expert consultation workflows**: Agents can consult specialists while maintaining orchestrator control
- **Complex approval processes**: Multiple specialists review work before returning to orchestrator
- **Quality assurance pipelines**: Work flows through specialists but orchestrator tracks progress

### Design Guidelines
**When to use:**
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="SendMessage (Orchestrator)" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    • Control and visibility    
    • Coordination between multiple agents    
    • Task-focused agent boundaries
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sequential Handoffs" icon="arrow-turn-right">
    • Internal agent decision-making    
    • Agents to have entire context     
    • Fewer agent-to-agent passes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**⚠️ Important**: In this framework, handoffs must be configured using `SendMessageHandoff` tools only. The `agent.handoffs` parameter is not supported.

## Benefits of the Hybrid Approach

- **Internal Delegation**: Agents can independently use handoffs to access necessary context and tools without additional agent-to-agent passes. 
- **Maintained Control**: Some agents can receive a short summary of the response to avoid hallucinations while other can receive full context to increase response accuracy and coverage. 
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: High-level coordination remains simple while detailed specialist work happens independently within appropriate agents. 

## Conclusion

Agency Swarm's hybrid paradigm resolution enables multi-agent architectures that would be difficult to achieve with either pattern alone.
By understanding how SendMessage tools and Sequential Handoffs work together, you can build systems that combine the best of both orchestration
and sequential delegation patterns, giving you the flexibility to design complex multi-agent workflows.
