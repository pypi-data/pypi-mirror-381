File Search Example

This example demonstrates how to enable file search capabilities for an agent by attaching
a file storage with automatic vector store processing.

Key Features:
- Automatic file processing and vector store creation from a files_folder directory
- Smart tool assignment based on file types:
  * CodeInterpreterTool for code and data files
  * FileSearchTool for text documents and PDFs
- Incremental file processing on agent reinitialization

How it works:
1. Files from the specified directory are processed and added to a vector store
2. The files folder is automatically renamed to include the vector store ID
3. On subsequent runs, the system scans for new files and adds them to the existing store
4. The agent can search across all files and provide citations for its answers

Note: You don't need to update the agent's files_folder parameter when the folder is renamed.
