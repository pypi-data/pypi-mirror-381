# fphysics — A Comprehensive Physics Library in Python

**fphysics** is a pure Python library that offers an extensive collection of physical constants, equations, and formulas.  
It’s built as a one-stop toolkit for students, researchers, educators, and developers — covering everything from classical mechanics to cutting-edge quantum theory.

## Key Features

- **Extensive Constants Database**  
  Includes essential physical constants — SI base units, quantum constants, astronomical parameters, and more.

- **Modular & Well-Organized Formula Collections**  
  Separate modules for mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, atomic physics, nuclear physics, relativity, statistical mechanics, and beyond.

- **Unit Conversion Made Easy**  
  Convert seamlessly between SI, CGS, and natural units.

- **Built for Learning & Research**  
  Perfect for integration into scientific calculators, simulations, teaching aids, or advanced research codebases.

## Installation

Once available on PyPI, install with:

```bash
pip install fphysics
```
