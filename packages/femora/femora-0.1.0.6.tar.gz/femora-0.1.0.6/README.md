  <em>A powerful framework for finite element meshing and seismic analysis</em>
</div>

## Overview

FEMORA (Fast Efficient Meshing for OpenSees-based Resilience Analysis) is a Python-based framework designed to simplify the creation, management, and analysis of complex finite element models for seismic analysis. Built on top of OpenSees, FEMORA provides an intuitive API for mesh generation, material definition, and analysis configuration with a focus on soil dynamics and seismic simulations.

## Key Features

- **Powerful Mesh Generation**: Create complex 3D soil and structural models with minimal code
- **Domain Reduction Method (DRM)**: Advanced seismic analysis technique for realistic wave propagation
- **Material Library**: Comprehensive collection of soil and structural materials
- **Analysis Components**: Full suite of solvers, algorithms, integrators, and convergence tests
- **Visualization Tools**: Built-in visualization capabilities for model inspection and result analysis
- **OpenSees Integration**: Seamless export to OpenSees TCL files for simulation
- **GUI Support**: Optional graphical interface for model construction and visualization

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher

### Using Virtual Environments (Recommended)

It's recommended to install FEMORA in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv femora-env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
femora-env\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source femora-env/bin/activate
```

### Method 1: Using pip

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install femora

# With GUI support
pip install femora[gui]

# Full installation with all dependencies
pip install femora[all]
```

### Method 2: From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amnp95/Femora.git
cd Femora
pip install -e .          # Basic installation
pip install -e ".[gui]"   # With GUI support
pip install -e ".[all]"   # Full installation with all dependencies
```
