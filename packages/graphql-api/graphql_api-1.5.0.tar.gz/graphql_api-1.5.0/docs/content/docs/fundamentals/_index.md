# Fundamentals

Master the core concepts of GraphQL API development. This section covers everything you need to understand GraphQL basics and build your first schemas.

## What You'll Learn

- **GraphQL basics** - Installation, schema definition, and type system
- **Data operations** - Queries, mutations, and input validation
- **Advanced types** - Enums, interfaces, and polymorphism
- **Data integration** - Pydantic, dataclasses, and async patterns

## Topics in This Section

These topics build on each other naturally:

1. **[Getting Started](getting-started/)** - Installation and your first GraphQL API
2. **[Schema Definition](defining-schemas/)** - Core concepts and decorator patterns
3. **[Field Types](field-types/)** - Complete type system and scalars
4. **[Object Types & Relationships](object-types/)** - Complex data modeling
5. **[Mutations & Input Types](mutations/)** - Data modifications and validation
6. **[Enums & Interfaces](enums-interfaces/)** - Advanced type modeling
7. **[Pydantic & Dataclasses](pydantic-and-dataclasses/)** - Data validation integration
8. **[Async & Subscriptions](async-and-subscriptions/)** - Real-time and async patterns

## What's Next

Once you're comfortable with the fundamentals, you can move on to **[Building Applications](../building-applications/)** to create complete CRUD applications with mutations and validation.
