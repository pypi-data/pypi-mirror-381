> **Complete documentation for GraphQL API, from basic concepts to advanced features.**

Welcome to the GraphQL API documentation! Build powerful GraphQL APIs with Python, from simple schemas to distributed production systems.

## Documentation Overview

The documentation is organized to support your development needs:

### Fundamentals
Start here to understand GraphQL basics and build your first API:

- **[Getting Started](fundamentals/getting-started/)** - Installation and your first GraphQL API
- **[Schema Definition](fundamentals/defining-schemas/)** - Core concepts and decorator patterns
- **[Field Types](fundamentals/field-types/)** - Scalars, collections, and custom types
- **[Object Types & Relationships](fundamentals/object-types/)** - Model complex business entities
- **[Mutations & Input Types](fundamentals/mutations/)** - Data modifications and validation
- **[Enums & Interfaces](fundamentals/enums-interfaces/)** - Advanced type modeling
- **[Pydantic & Dataclasses](fundamentals/pydantic-and-dataclasses/)** - Data validation integration
- **[Async & Subscriptions](fundamentals/async-and-subscriptions/)** - Real-time and async patterns

### Building Applications
Create complete, production-ready applications with documentation and error handling:

- **[Schema Documentation](building-applications/documentation/)** - Self-documenting schemas with introspection
- **[Error Handling](building-applications/error-handling/)** - Robust error management

### Production
Prepare for production deployment with middleware and advanced request handling:

- **[Middleware](production/middleware/)** - Authentication, logging, and monitoring
- **[Context & Metadata](production/context-metadata/)** - Request context and resolver metadata

### Advanced Features
Implement sophisticated patterns and dynamic behavior:

- **[Custom Directives](advanced-features/directives/)** - Schema directives and custom behavior
- **[Schema Filtering](advanced-features/schema-filtering/)** - Dynamic access control
- **[Performance](advanced-features/performance/)** - Optimization techniques and best practices

### Distributed Systems
Build microservices and distributed GraphQL architectures:

- **[Remote GraphQL](distributed-systems/remote-graphql/)** - Service integration and remote execution
- **[Federation](distributed-systems/federation/)** - Microservices and distributed schemas
- **[Relay Pagination](distributed-systems/pagination-relay/)** - Advanced client integration patterns
- **[Federation](federation/)** - Microservices and distributed schemas
- **[Relay Pagination](pagination-relay/)** - Advanced client integration patterns

### Reference & Examples
Complete API documentation and real-world patterns:

- **[Examples](examples/)** - Real-world use cases and patterns
- **[API Reference](api-reference/)** - Complete API documentation
- **[Contributing](contributing/)** - Contribute to the project
