QCoDeS |PyPi| |DOCS| |PyPI python versions| |DOI|
=================================================
|Build Status Github| |Build Status Github Docs| |Ruff| |OpenSSF|

QCoDeS is a Python-based data acquisition framework developed by the
Copenhagen / Delft / Sydney / Microsoft quantum computing consortium.
While it has been developed to serve the needs of nanoelectronic device
experiments, it is not inherently limited to such experiments, and can
be used anywhere a system with many degrees of freedom is controllable
by computer.
To learn more about QCoDeS, browse our `homepage <http://microsoft.github.io/Qcodes>`_ .

To get a feeling of QCoDeS read
`15 minutes to QCoDeS <https://microsoft.github.io/Qcodes/examples/basic_examples/15_minutes_to_QCoDeS.html>`__,
and/or browse the Jupyter notebooks in `docs/examples
<https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/tree/main/docs/examples>`__ .

QCoDeS is compatible with Python 3.11+. It is
primarily intended for use from Jupyter notebooks, but can be used from
traditional terminal-based shells and in stand-alone scripts as well. The
features in `qcodes.utils.magic` are exclusively for Jupyter notebooks.


Default branch is now main
==========================

The default branch in QCoDeS has been renamed to main.
If you are working with a local clone of QCoDeS you should update it as follows:

* Run `git fetch origin` and `git checkout main`
* Run `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main` to update your HEAD reference.

Install
=======

In general, refer to `here <http://microsoft.github.io/Qcodes/start/index.html#installation>`__
for installation.


Docs
====

Read it `here <http://microsoft.github.io/Qcodes>`__ .
Documentation is updated and deployed on every successful build in main.

We use sphinx for documentations, makefiles are provided both for
Windows, and \*nix, so that you can build the documentation locally.

Make sure that you have the extra dependencies required to install the docs

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r docs_requirements.txt

Go to the directory ``docs`` and

.. code:: bash

    make html

This generate a webpage, index.html, in ``docs/_build/html`` with the
rendered html.

QCoDeS Loop
===========

The modules ``qcodes.data``, ``qcodes.plots``, ``qcodes.actions``,
``qcodes.loops``, ``qcodes.measure``, ``qcodes.extensions.slack``
and ``qcodes.utils.magic`` that were part of QCoDeS until version 0.37.0.
have been moved into an independent package called qcodes_loop.
Please see it's `repository <https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes_loop/>`_ and
`documentation <https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes_loop/index.html>`_ for more information.

For the time being it is possible to automatically install the qcodes_loop
package when installing qcodes by executing ``pip install qcodes[loop]``.
