    Atom information, where an atom is the smallest schedulable set of steps
    such that useful science can be obtained from performing them.
    Wavelengths must be specified in microns.

    Attributes:

        id (int): GPP atom `id`. In other case is given by the Provider
        exec_time (timedelta): Total planned time of execution.
        prog_time (timedelta): Planned program time.
        part_time (timedelta): Planned partner time.
        program_used (timedelta): Used (charged) program time.
        partner_used (timedelta): Used (charged) partner time.
        not_charged (timedelta): Not charged time (e.g. have to repeat)
        observed (bool): True if the STATUS is already observed.
        qa_state (QAState):
        guide_state (bool): True if a state exists.
        resources (Resources): Resources needed (Instrument, FPU, etc).
        wavelengths (Wavelengths): Set of wavelengths.
