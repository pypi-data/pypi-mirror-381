# sysutil-lib
- Linux system information library

## Warning
- this library is ment to be used only in linux systems
- it is possible to write code using it on other systems, but it will not allow to run the code, raising an exception before execution

## Other implementations
- this library is also available for Rust
- check it out at [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/sysutil)
