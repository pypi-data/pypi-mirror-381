> ***NornFlow is still in beta phase.***

## What is NornFlow?
NornFlow is a lightweight workflow orchestration framework built on top of [Nornir](https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir), bringing structure and predictability to network automation projects.

NornFlow bridges the gap between development and operations teams by providing:

- A **structured workflow system** for organizing Nornir tasks into reusable automation flows
- A **declarative YAML interface** for defining complex automation sequences
- A **command-line interface** for running individual Nornir tasks or complete workflows
- A **variable system** with multi-level precedence for flexible customization

## Why Use NornFlow?

NornFlow promotes collaboration between developers and network engineers:

‚ö°Ô∏è **Unlimited Power for Developer**: Write automation logic as pure Python functions with Nornir's task interface. No boilerplate, just clean Python code.

üöÄ **Productivity for Operators**: Define and run workflows with familiar YAML syntax similar to Ansible playbooks, enabling network engineers to be productive regardless of their Python programming background.

üß© **Project-friendly**: Brings predictable structure to Nornir projects with:
- Standardized directory organization
- Consistent workflow definition patterns
- Clear separation between tasks, workflows, and inventory
