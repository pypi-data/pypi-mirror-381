class NornFlowSettings:
    """
    This class is used to store NornFlow settings for access during runtime.

    For initialization, it requires the location of a YAML file that holds the settings.
    This will be determined with the following order of preference:
        - through an environment variable named `NORNFLOW_SETTINGS`.
        - through the `settings_file` argument.
        - a default file named 'nornflow.yaml' is assumed to exist.

    To allow for extensibility and customizations, NornFlow was designed with the following
    principles in mind:
        1 - NornFlow settings and Nornir configs are kept separate, hence the need for a
           `nornir_config_file` setting in the NornFlow settings YAML file.

        2 - a minimal set of REQUIRED settings.

        3 - a minimal set of OPTIONAL settings that can also be passed explicitly to the Class
            initializer as keyword arguments.

        4 - there's no fixed set of "acceptable settings". Users can add more settings if
            they want to extend NornFlow to support custom use-cases, but currently this is
            only supported through the YAML file, not through keyword arguments.

        5 - settings can be accessed as attributes of a NornFlowSettings object:
            NornFlowSettings().local_tasks_dirs # returns the 'local_tasks_dirs' setting

        6 - trying to access non-supported settings also not informed in the YAML file
            will simply return None:
            NornFlowSettings().non_existing_setting_not_informed_in_yaml_either  # returns None
