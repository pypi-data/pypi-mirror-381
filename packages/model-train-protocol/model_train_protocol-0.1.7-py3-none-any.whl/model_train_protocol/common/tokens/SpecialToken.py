        A SpecialToken is a subclass of Token that includes an additional 'special' attribute
        to identify tokens with special significance or behavior. Also removes the trailing underscore from the value.

        :param desc: Optional description of the token. Extends the value to contextualize its use.
        :param special: Special attribute to identify special tokens.
