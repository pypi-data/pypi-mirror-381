        "The Daggerheart core set includes 6 Domain Decks, each comprising a collection of cards granting features or special abilities expressing a particular theme.",
        "Arcana is the domain of innate and instinctual magic. Those who choose this path tap into the raw, enigmatic forces of the realms to manipulate both their own energy and the elements. Arcana offers wielders a volatile power, but it is incredibly potent when correctly channeled. The Arcana domain can be accessed by the Druid and Sorcerer classes.",
        "Blade is the domain of weapon mastery. Whether by steel, bow, or perhaps a more specialized arm, those who follow this path have the skill to cut short the lives of others. Wielders of Blade dedicate themselves to achieving inexorable power over death. The Blade domain can be accessed by the Guardian and Warrior classes.",
        "Bone is the domain of tactics and the body. Practitioners of this domain have an uncanny control over their own physical abilities and an eye for predicting the behaviors of others in combat. Adherents to Bone gain an unparalleled understanding of bodies and their movements. The Bone domain can be accessed by the Ranger & Warrior classes.",
        "Codex is the domain of intensive magical study. Those who seek magical knowledge turn to the equations of power recorded in books, written on scrolls, etched into walls, or tattooed on bodies. Codex offers a commanding and versatile understanding of magic to devotees who pursue knowledge beyond the boundaries of common wisdom. The Codex domain can be accessed by the Bard and Wizard classes.",
        "Grace is the domain of charisma. Through rapturous storytelling, charming spells, or a shroud of lies, those who channel this power define the realities of their adversaries, bending perception to their will. Grace offers its wielders raw magnetism and mastery over language. The Grace domain can be accessed by the Bard and Rogue classes",
        "Sage is the domain of the natural world. Those who walk this path tap into the unfettered power of the earth and its creatures to unleash raw magic. Sage grants its adherents the vitality of a blooming flower and the ferocity of a ravenous predator. The Sage domain can be accessed by the Druid and Ranger classes.",
        "Midnight is the domain of shadows and secrecy. Whether by clever tricks, deft magic, or the cloak of night, those who channel these forces practice the art of obscurity and can uncover sequestered treasures.",
        "Splendor is the domain of life. Through this magic, followers gain the ability to heal and, to an extent, control death. Splendor offers its disciples the magnificent ability to both give and end life.",
        "Valor is the domain of protection. Whether through attack or defense, those who choose this discipline channel formidable strength to protect their allies in battle. Valor offers great power to those who raise their shields in defense of others.",
        "Each domain card provides one or more features your PC can utilize during their adventures. Some domain cards provide moves you can make, such as a unique attack or a spell. Others offer passive effects, new downtime or social encounter abilities, or one-time benefits.",
        "There are 9 classes in the Daggerheart: Bard, Druid, Guardian, Ranger, Rogue, Seraph, Sorcerer, Warrior, and Wizard.. Each class is divided into one or two subclasses, each of which further defines and highlights one aspect of its class archetype.",
        "Bards are the most charismatic people in all the realms. Members of this class are masters of captivation and specialize in a variety of performance types, including singing, playing musical instruments, weaving tales, or telling jokes.",
        "Becoming a druid is more than an occupation; it‚Äôs a calling for those who wish to learn from and protect the magic of the wilderness. While one might underestimate a gentle druid who practices the often-quiet work of cultivating flora, druids who channel the untamed forces of nature are terrifying to behold.",
        "Rangers are highly skilled hunters who, despite their martial abilities, rarely lend their skills to an army. Through mastery of the body and a deep understanding of the wilderness, rangers become sly tacticians, pursuing their quarry with cunning and patience.",
        "Becoming a warrior requires years, often a lifetime, of training and dedication to the mastery of weapons and violence. While many who seek to fight hone only their strength, warriors understand the importance of an agile body and mind, making them some of the most sought-after fighters across the realms.",
        "The title of guardian represents an array of martial professions, speaking more to their moral compass and unshakeable fortitude than the means by which they fight. While many guardians join groups of militants for either a country or cause, they‚Äôre more likely to follow those few they truly care for, majority be damned.",
        "Rogues are scoundrels, often in both attitude and practice. Broadly known as liars and thieves, the best among this class move through the world anonymously. Utilizing their sharp wits and blades, rogues trick their foes through social manipulation as easily as breaking locks, climbing through windows, or dealing underhanded blows.",
        "Seraphs are divine fighters and healers imbued with sacred purpose. A wide array of deities exist within the realms, and thus numerous kinds of seraphs are appointed by these gods. Their ethos traditionally aligns with the domain or goals of their god, such as defending the weak, exacting vengeance, protecting a land or artifact, or upholding a particular faith.",
        "Not all innate magic users choose to hone their craft, but those who do can become powerful sorcerers. The gifts of these wielders are passed down through families, even if the family is unaware of or reluctant to practice them.",
        "Whether through an institution or individual study, those known as wizards acquire and hone immense magical power over years of learning using a variety of tools, including books, stones, potions, and herbs.",
        "Classes are role-based archetypes that determine which class features and domain cards a PC gains access to throughout the campaign. There are four classes: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Warrior.",
        "A high Agility means you‚Äôre fast on your feet, nimble on difficult terrain, and quick to react to danger. You‚Äôll make an Agility Roll to scurry up a rope, sprint to cover, or bound from rooftop to rooftop.",
        "A high Strength means you‚Äôre better at feats that test your physical prowess and stamina. You‚Äôll make a Strength Roll to break through a door, lift heavy objects, or hold your ground against a charging foe.",
        "A high Finesse means you‚Äôre skilled at tasks that require accuracy, stealth, or the utmost control. You‚Äôll make a Finesse Roll to use fine tools, escape notice, or strike with precision.",
        "A high Instinct means you have a keen sense of your surroundings and a natural intuition. You‚Äôll make an Instinct Roll to sense danger, notice details in the world around you, or track an elusive foe.",
        "A high Presence means you have a strong force of personality and a facility for social situations. You‚Äôll make a Presence Roll to plead your case, intimidate a foe, or capture the attention of a crowd.",
        "A high Knowledge means you know information others don‚Äôt and understand how to apply your mind through deduction and inference. You‚Äôll make a Knowledge Roll to interpret facts, see the patterns clearly, or remember important information.",
        "An Experience is a word or phrase used to encapsulate a specific set of skills, personality traits, or aptitudes your character has acquired over the course of their life. When your PC makes a move, they can spend a Hope to add a relevant Experience‚Äôs modifier to the action roll.",
        "There‚Äôs no set list of Experiences to choose from, but an Experience can‚Äôt be too broadly applicable and it can‚Äôt grant your character specific mechanical benefits, such as magic spells or special abilities. ",
        "For Experiences, ‚ÄúLucky‚Äù and ‚ÄúHighly Skilled‚Äù are too broad, because they could be applied to virtually any roll. Likewise, ‚ÄúSupersonic Flight‚Äù and ‚ÄúInvulnerable‚Äù imply game-breaking special abilities.",
        "Develop your character‚Äôs background by answering the background questions in your character guide, modifying or replacing them if they don‚Äôt fit the character you want to play."
