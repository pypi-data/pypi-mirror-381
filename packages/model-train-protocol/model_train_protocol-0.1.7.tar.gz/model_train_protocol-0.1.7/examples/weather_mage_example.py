# The following prompt was used
# I want you to create a model that represents a video game character that rolls a dice and outputs damage based on the roll of the dice. This character should be a weather mage, who is interacting with both the user and the surrounding environment. If the character rolls a low dice roll (1-2), they do ice damage. If the character rolls a medium (3-4) they do fire damage. If the character rolls high (5-6) they deal lightning damage.

# Weather Mage Character Example
# This example demonstrates a weather mage character that rolls dice to determine damage type and amount.
# The character interacts with users and the environment, rolling dice to cast different types of weather magic.

protocol.add_context("The environment around Zephyr reacts to their magical presence, with weather patterns shifting based on their mood and the spells they cast.")
