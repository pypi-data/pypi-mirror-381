# Mybox

🖥️ This is a box. 📦 And it is mine. 🐱

There are many 🍱 nice things in there. I wouldn't want 🧰 to be without them.

Even if I move 🏠 or work 🏢 I want to be comfortable.

Manage the configuration and tools on your workstation without bothering the OS
too much (maybe your favorite one isn't supported by `$WORK` or you have
different ones for different roles).

## Values

0. Earlier points override latter ones, unless there is a huge gain.
1. The system is usable with the software the user specified.
2. Meta requirements (e.g. archivers and package managers) are installed the
   same way user requirements are.
3. Everything is installed and upgraded to the latest version every time.
4. Superuser access is not required.

## Usage

* Run the [bootstrap](bootstrap) script:

  ```shell
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/koterpillar/mybox/releases/latest/download/bootstrap)"
  ```

* Run `mybox-python` from the directory with package definitions.

  For package definition examples, see
  [koterpillar/desktop](https://github.com/koterpillar/desktop/).

## Development

Pre-requisites (see [install-dev](bin/install-dev) for ways to install):

* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
* [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/)

Run [`./bin/lint`](bin/lint) to check style & types, `./bin/lint --format` to apply
formatting automatically.

Run [`./bin/test`](bin/test) to execute the project's tests.

### Running locally

* Run `poetry install`.
* Run `poetry shell`.
* In the launched shell, go to the directory with package definitions.
* Run `mybox-python` with the desired arguments.

### Releasing

Releases are done using Semantic Release, see [build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml).
