## Installation

You can install the Payarc SDK using pip (for Python projects).

```bash
$ pip install payarc
```

## Usage

Before you can use the Payarc SDK, you need to initialize it with your API key and the URL base point. This is required for authenticating your requests and specifying the endpoint for the APIs. For each environment (prod, sandbox) both parameters have different values. This information should stay on your server and security measures must be taken not to share it with your customers. Provided examples use package [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) to store this information and provide it on the constructor. It is not mandatory to use this approach as your setup could be different.
In case you want to take benefits of candidate merchant functionality you need so-called Agent identification token. This token could be obtained from the portal.

You have to create `.env` file in root of your project and update the following rows after =
```ini
PAYARC_ENV=''
PAYARC_KEY=''
AGENT_KEY=''
```
then install [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) package
```bash
```bash
$ pip install python-dotenv
```

You have to create object from SDK to call different methods depends on business needs. Optional you can load `.env` file into configuration by adding the following code:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
load_dotenv()
```

then you create instance of the SDK
```python
/**
 * Creates an instance of Payarc.
 * @param {string} bearer_token - The bearer token for authentication.Mandatory parameter to construct the object
 * @param {string} [base_url='sandbox'] - The url of access points possible values prod or sandbox, as sandbox is the default one. Vary for testing playground and production. can be set in environment file too.
 * @param {string} [api_version='/v1/'] - The version of access points for now 1(it has default value thus could be omitted).
 * @param {string} [version='1.0'] - API version.
 * @param {string} bearer_token_agent - The bearer token for agent authentication. Only required if you need functionality around candidate merchant
 * 
 */
from payarc import Payarc

payarc = Payarc(
    bearer_token=os.getenv('PAYARC_KEY'),
    bearer_token_agent=os.getenv('AGENT_KEY'),
    base_url=os.getenv('PAYARC_BASE_URL'),
    version=os.getenv('PAYARC_VERSION')
)
```
if no errors you are good to go.

## Creating a Charge
### Example: Create a Charge with Minimum Information
To create a `payment(charge)` from a customer, minimum information required is:
- `amount` converted in cents,
- `currency` equal to 'usd',
- `source` the credit card which will be debited with the amount above.

For credit card minimum needed attributes are `card number` and `expiration date`. For full list of attributes see API documentation.
This example demonstrates how to create a charge with the minimum required information:

```python
import asyncio

async def create_charge_example():
    charge_data = {
        "amount": 1785,
        "currency": "usd",
        "source": {
            "card_number": "4012000098765439",
            "exp_month": "03",
            "exp_year": "2025",
        }
    }

    try:
        charge = await payarc.charges['create'](charge_data)
        print('Success, the charge is:', charge)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(create_charge_example())
```
### Example: Create a Charge by Token
To create a payment(charge) from a customer, minimum information required is:
- `amount` converted in cents,
- `currency` equal to 'usd',
- `source` an object that has attribute `token_id`. this can be obtained by the [CREATE TOKEN API](https://docs.payarc.net/#ee16415a-8d0c-4a71-a5fe-48257ca410d7) for token creation.
This example shows how to create a charge using a token:

```python
async def create_charge_by_token():
    charge_data = {
        "amount": 3785,
        "currency": "usd",
        "source": {
            "token_id": "tok_mEL8xxxxLqLL8wYl"
        }
    }
    try:
        charge = await payarc.charges['create'](charge_data)
        print('Success, the charge is:', charge)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
```

### Example: Create a Charge by Card ID

Charge can be generated over specific credit card (cc) if you know the cc's ID and customer's ID to which this card belongs.
This example demonstrates how to create a charge using a card ID:

```python
async def create_charge_by_card_id():
    charge_data = {
        "amount": 3785,
        "currency": "usd",
        "source": {
            "card_id": "card_Ly9tetrt59M0m1",
            "customer_id": "cus_jMNetettyynDp"
        }
    }
    try:
        charge = await payarc.charges['create'](charge_data)
        print('Success, the charge is:', charge)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

 asyncio.run(create_charge_by_card_id())
```
### Example: Create a Charge by Customer ID

This example shows how to create a charge using a customer ID:

```python
async def create_charge_by_customer_id():
    charge_data = {
        "amount": 5785,
        "currency": "usd",
        "source": {
            "customer_id": "cus_jMNetettyynDp"
        }
    }
    try:
        charge = await payarc.charges['create'](charge_data)
        print('Success, the charge is:', charge)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

 asyncio.run(create_charge_by_customer_id())
```

### Example: Create a Charge by Bank account ID

This example shows how to create an ACH charge when you know the bank account 

```python
async def create_charge_by_bank_account():
    try:
        customer = await payarc.customers['retrieve']('cus_jMNKVMPKnNxPVnDp')
        charge = await customer['charges']['create']({
            'amount':6699,
            'sec_code': 'WEB',
            'source': {
                'bank_account_id': 'bnk_eJjbbbbbblL'
            }
        })
        print('Charge created successfully:', charge)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(create_charge_by_bank_account())
```

Example make ACH charge with new bank account. Details for bank account are send in attribute source

```python
async def create_ach_charge_by_bank_account_details():
    try:
        customer = await payarc.customers['retrieve']('cus_jMNKVMPKnNxPVnDp')
        charge = await customer['charges']['create']({
            'amount': 6699,
            'sec_code': 'WEB',
            'source': {
                 'account_number':'123432575352',
                 'routing_number':'123345349',
                 'first_name': 'FirstName III',
                 'last_name':'LastName III',
                 'account_type': 'Personal Savings',
            }
        })
        print('Charge created successfully:', charge)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

asyncio.run(create_ach_charge_by_bank_account_details())
```

### Example: Create a Charge with Split (Instructional Funding)
This example demonstrates how to create a charge with split instructions.

Merchants configured with instructional funding are required to include the splits array in the request payload.

At least one valid split instruction must be provided — otherwise, the request may result in errors and could delay funding of the transaction.
```python
async def create_instructional_funding_charge():
     charge_data = {
        "amount": 120,
        "currency": "usd",
        "source": {
            "card_number": "4012*********5439",
            "exp_month": "03",
            "exp_year": "2025",
            "splits": [
                {
                    "mid": "070990*******900",
                    "amount": 20,
                    "description": "Application fee"
                },
                {
                    "mid": "06099*********14",
                    "amount": 100,
                    "description": "Platform fee"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    try:
        charge = await payarc.charges['create'](charge_data)
        print('Success, the charge is:', charge)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(create_instructional_funding_charge())
```

                    "mid": "06099*********14",
                    "amount": 90,
                    "description": "Platform fee updated"
                }
            ]
        })
        print('Charge splits adjusted successfully:', adjusted_charge)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(adjust_splits_for_charge('ch_M*********noOWL'))
```
This example demonstrates how to adjust splits for an existing charge with instructional funding by charge object.
```python
async def adjust_splits_by_charge_obj(id):
    try:
        charge = await payarc.charges['retrieve'](id)
        adjusted_charge = await charge['adjust_splits']({
            "splits": [
                {
                    "mid": "070990*******900",
                    "amount": 30,
                    "description": "Application fee updated"
                },
                {
                    "mid": "06099*********14",
                    "amount": 90,
                    "description": "Platform fee updated"
                }
            ]
        })
        print('Charge splits adjusted successfully:', adjusted_charge)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(adjust_splits_by_charge_obj('ch_M*********noOWL'))
```

### Example: Create Instructional Funding
This example demonstrates how to transfer money to my payees via instructional funding:

```python

    split_data = {
        "mid": "070990********6",
        "amount": 30,
        "description": "Application fee created",
        # "include": "charge" // optional
        # "charge_id": "ch_nbDB*******RnMORX" // optional
    }
    try:
        split = await payarc.charges['create_instructional_funding'](split_data)
        print('Success, the money transfer is:', split)
    except Exception as error:

    try:
        refund = await payarc.charges['create_refund'](id, options)
        print('Success, the refund is:', refund)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
 asyncio.run(refund_charge('ach_g9dDE7GDdeDG08eA'))
```
## Managing Webhooks on Agent Level
#### Webhooks management is available for agents only. To use this functionality you need to provide agent token on the constructor of the SDK.
#### There are 4 type of webhooks that could be created:
- `merchant.onboarded.webhook`
- `lead.updated.webhook`
- `lead.category.updated.webhook`
- `lead.underwriting.updated.webhook`
### Example: Create Webhook
This example demonstrates how to create a webhook:
```python
async def create_webhook_example():
    webhook_data = {
        # 'key': 'merchant.onboarded.webhook',
        'key': 'lead.category.updated.webhook',
        'value': 12,
    }
    try:
        webhook = await payarc.user_settings['agent']['webhooks']['create'](webhook_data)
        print('Webhook created:', webhook)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(create_webhook_example())
```

### Example: List Webhooks
This example demonstrates how to list all webhooks:
```python
async def list_webhooks_example():
    try:
        webhooks = await payarc.user_settings['agent']['webhooks']['list']()
        print('Webhooks:')
        pprint.pprint(webhooks, width=120, compact=True)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(list_webhooks_example())

### Example: Update Webhook
This example demonstrates how to update a webhook:
```python
async def update_webhook_example():
    webhook_data = {
        'key': 'merchant.onboarded.webhook',
        'value': 1,
    }
    try:
        webhook = await payarc.user_settings['agent']['webhooks']['update'](webhook_data)
        print('Webhook updated:', webhook)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(update_webhook_example())
```

        if webhook:
            webhook['value'] = 13
            updated_webhook = await webhook['update']()
            print('Webhook updated:', updated_webhook)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

## Managing Batches
#### Batch reporting is available for agents only. To use this functionality you need to provide agent token on the constructor of the SDK.
### Example: List Batches with No Constraints
This example demonstrates how to list all batches without any constraints:
> [!NOTE] 
> When no date range is passed, the current month is used by default.
```python
async def list_agent_batches(options=None):
    try:
        batches = await payarc.batches['agent']['list'](options)
        print("Agent Batches:")
        pprint.pprint(batches, width=120, compact=True)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(list_agent_batches({}))
```
### Example: List Batches with Date Range
This example shows how to list batches within a specific date range:
```python
async def list_agent_batches_with_date_range(start_date, end_date):
    try:
        options = {
            'from_date': start_date,
            'to_date': end_date
        }
        batches = await payarc.batches['agent']['list'](options)
        print("Agent Batches:")
        pprint.pprint(batches, width=120, compact=True)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(list_agent_batches_with_date_range('2023-01-01', '2023-01-31'))
```
### Example: Retrieve a Batch
This example shows how to retrieve a specific batch by its REFERENCE NUMBER, MID and DATE: (all three are mandatory)
```python
async def get_batch_details(options=None):
    try:
        batch = await payarc.batches['agent']['details'](options)
        print("Batch Details:")
        pprint.pprint(batch, width=120, compact=True)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(get_batch_details({
    'batch_reference_number': '20230930-000001',
    'mid': '123456789012345',
    'batch_date': '2023-09-30'
}))
```
### Example: Retrieve a Batch by Object
This example shows how to retrieve a specific batch by its object:
```python
async def get_batch_details_by_obj(options=None):
    try:
        batches = await payarc.batches['agent']['list'](options)
        batch = batches['batches'][1]
        details = await batch['details']()
        print("Batch Details:")
        pprint.pprint(details, width=120, compact=True)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(get_batch_details_by_obj({
    'from_date': '2025-05-30',
    'to_date': '2025-05-30'
}))
```

## Manage Candidate Merchants
### Create new Candidate Merchant
In the process of connecting your clients with Payarc a selection is made based on Payarc's criteria. Process begins with filling information for the merchant and creating an entry in the database. Here is an example how this process could start
```python
async def create_candidate_merchant():
    try:
        merccandidate = {
                "Lead":
                    {
                        "Industry": "cbd",
                        "MerchantName": "My applications company",
                        "LegalName": "Best Co in w",
                        "ContactFirstName": "Joan",
                        "ContactLastName": "Dhow",
                        "ContactEmail": "contact+23@mail.com",
                        "DiscountRateProgram": "interchange"
                    },
                "Owners": [
                    {
                        "FirstName": "First",
                        "LastName": "Last",
                        "Title": "President",
                        "OwnershipPct": 100,
                        "Address": "Somewhere",
                        "City": "City Of Test",
                        "SSN": "4546-0034",
                        "State": "WY",
                        "ZipCode": "10102",
                        "BirthDate": "1993-06-24",
                        "Email": "nikoj@negointeresuva.com",
                        "PhoneNo": "2346456784"
                    }
                ]
            }
        candidate = await payarc.applications['create'](merccandidate)
        print('Candidate created successfully:', candidate)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(create_candidate_merchant())
```
In this example attribute `Lead` is an object representing the business as the attribute `Owners` is and array of objects representing the owners of this business. Note this is the minimum information required. For successful boarding you should provide as much information as you can, for reference see documentation. In some case the logged user has to create application in behalf of some other agent. in this case the `object_id` of this agent must be sent in the object sent to function `payarc.applications.create`.To obtain the list of agent you can use function `listSubAgents` as it is shown on examples:
```python
async def create_candidate_in_behalf_of_other_agent():
    try:
        merccandidate = {
            "Lead":
                {
                    "Industry": "cbd",
                    "MerchantName": "My applications company",
                    "LegalName": "Best Co in w",
                    "ContactFirstName": "Joan",
                    "ContactLastName": "Dhow",
                    "ContactEmail": "contact+23@mail.com",
                    "DiscountRateProgram": "interchange"
                },
            "Owners": [
                {
                    "FirstName": "First",
                    "LastName": "Last",
                    "Title": "President",
                    "OwnershipPct": 100,
                    "Address": "Somewhere",
                    "City": "City Of Test",
                    "SSN": "4546-0034",
                    "State": "WY",
                    "ZipCode": "10102",
                    "BirthDate": "1993-06-24",
                    "Email": "nikoj@negointeresuva.com",
                    "PhoneNo": "2346456784"
                }
            ]
        }
        sub_agent = await payarc.applications['list_sub_agents']()
        merccandidate['agentId'] = sub_agent[0]['object_id'] if sub_agent else None
        candidate = await payarc.applications['create'](merccandidate)
        print('Candidate created successfully:', candidate)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(create_candidate_in_behalf_of_other_agent())
```

### Check Status of Candidate Merchant
To check the status of a candidate merchant, you can use the `status` method. This will return the current status of the application, such as whether it is in a submitted, approved, or declined state.

```python
async def check_candidate_status(id):
    try:
        candidate = await payarc.applications['status'](id)
        print('Candidate status:', candidate)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(check_candidate_status('appl_**********njA'))
```

### Retrieve Information for Candidate Merchant
To continue with onboarding process you might need to provide additional information or to inquiry existing leads. In the SDK  following functions exists: `list` and `retrieve`. 

List all candidate merchant for current agent
```python
async def list_applications():
    try:
        response = await payarc.applications['list']()
        applications = response['applications']
        print(applications)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

asyncio.run(list_applications())
```
Retrieve data for current candidate merchant
```python
async def get_candiate_merchant_by_id(id):
    try:
        candidate = await payarc.applications['retrieve'](id)
        print('Candidate retrieved successfully:', candidate)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
   
asyncio.run(get_candiate_merchant_by_id('appl_**********njA'))
```
Retrieve data for candidate merchant from a list inc documents
```python
async def list_inc_documents():
    try:
        response = await payarc.applications['list']()
        applicant = response['applications'][-1]
        details = await applicant['retrieve']()
        print(details['Documents'])
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(list_inc_documents())
```
Update properties of candidate merchant
```python
async def update_candidate_merchant(id):
    try:
        updated_candidate = await payarc.applications['update'](id,
                            {
                                "MerchantBankAccountNo": "987396827",
                                "MerchantBankRoutingNo": "1848505",
                                "BankInstitutionName": "Bank of something"
                            })
        print('Candidate updated successfully:', updated_candidate)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(update_candidate_merchant('appl_**********njA'))
```

### Documents management
SDK is providing possibility of adding or removing documents with `add_document` and `delete_document` respectively. 

Example for adding supportive documents to candidate merchant
```python
async def add_document_to_candidate_merchant(id):
    try:
        candidate = await payarc.applications['retrieve'](id)
        document = await candidate['data']['add_document']({
                "DocumentType": "Business Bank Statement",
                "DocumentName": "sample document 1",

        })
        print('Document added successfully:', document)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(add_document_to_candidate_merchant('appl_**********njA'))
```
In this example we search for all candidate merchants and on the last added in the system we attach a document (Payarc logo) that will be used in on boarding process. See documentation for document attributes.
In case document is no longer needed you can see those examples
```python
async def remove_document_from_candidate_merchant():
    try:
        candidates = await payarc.applications['list']()
        applicant = candidates['applications'][-1]
        details = await applicant['retrieve']()
        document = details.get('Documents', {}).get('data', [None])[0]
        if document:
            deleted_doc = await document['delete']()
            print('Document deleted successfully:', deleted_doc)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(remove_document_from_candidate_merchant())
```
Again we search for the last candidate and remove first found (if exists) document. In case we already know the document ID, for example if we retrieve information for candidate you can use  

```python
async def remove_document_by_id():
    try:
        deleted_doc = await payarc.applications['delete_document']('doc_3joyr*********vx')
        print('Document deleted successfully:', deleted_doc)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(remove_document_by_id())
```

### Signature
As agent or ISV the process is completed once the contract between Payarc and your client is sent to this client for signature. Once all documents and data is collected method `submit` of the candidate merchant must be invoked, here is an example
```python
async def submit_application():
    try:
        application = await payarc.applications['submit']('appl_3aln*******8y8')
        print('Application submitted successfully:', application)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(submit_application())
```

## Manage Payees
### Create Payee
To create a payee use function `create` of object `payees`. Here is an example
```python
async def add_payee():
    body_params = {
        "type": "sole_prop",
        "personal_info": {
            "first_name": "Test Name",
            "last_name": "Test Lastname",

            # "D" - "Non Profit Verification Pending"
            # "F" - "Foreign Entity Verified"
            # "G" - "Government Entity"
            # "J" - "Financial Institution"
            # "N" - "Not Excluded"
        },
        "contact_info": {
            "email": "example.com",
            "phone_number": "5566778843"
        },
        "address_info": {
            "street": "OPulchenska 10",
            "city": "Example City",
            "zip_code": "22334",

        "foundation_date": "2025-10-02",
        "date_incorporated": "2025-10-02"
    }
    try:
        payee = await payarc.payees['create'](body_params)
        print('Payee created:', payee)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(add_payee())
```
### Retrieve Payee
To retrieve details for existing payee use function `retrieve` of object `payees`. Here is an example
```python
async def get_payee_by_id(id):
    try:
        payee = await payarc.payees['retrieve'](id)
        print('Payee retrieved:', payee)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(get_payee_by_id('appl_3aln*******8y8'))
```
### List all Payees
To list all payees use function `list` of object `payees`. Here is an example
```python
async def list_all_payees():
    try:
        payees = await payarc.payees['list']()
        print('Payees:', payees)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(list_all_payees())
```
### Status of Payee
To check status of existing payee use function `status` of object `payees`. Here is an example
```python
async def check_payee_status(id):
    try:
        payee = await payarc.payees['status'](id)
        print('Payee status:', payee)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(check_payee_status('appl_3aln*******8y8'))
```
### Delete Payee
To delete existing payee use function `delete` of object `payees`. Here is an example
```python
async def delete_payee_by_id(id):
    try:
        payee = await payarc.payees['delete'](id)
        print('Payee deleted:', payee)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
asyncio.run(delete_payee_by_id('appl_3aln*******8y8'))
```
## Split Payment

As ISV you can create campaigns to manage financial details around your processing merchants. In the SDK the object representing this functionality is `split_campaigns` this object has functions to create. list, update campaigns. Here below are examples related to manipulation of campaign.


### List all campaigns

To inquiry all campaigns available for your agent
```python
async def list_campaign():
    try:
        campaigns = await payarc.split_campaigns['list']()
        print('Campaigns:', campaigns)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

asyncio.run(list_campaign())
```

as result a list of campaigns is returned. based on this list you can update details


### List all processing merchants

Use this function to get collection of processing merchants. Later on you can assign campaigns to them
```python
async def list_all_processing_merchants():
    try:
        merchants = await payarc.split_campaigns['list_accounts']()
        print('Merchants:', merchants['campaign_accounts'])
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

asyncio.run(list_all_processing_merchants())
```


### Create and retrieve details for campaign

Use this function to create new campaign
```python
async def create_campaign():
    try:
        campaign = await payarc.split_campaigns['create']({
            'name': 'Mega bonus',
            'description': "Compliment for my favorite customers",
            'note': "Only for VIPs",
            'base_charge': 33.33,
            'perc_charge': 7.77,
            'is_default': '0',
            'accounts': []
        })
        print('Campaign created:', campaign)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

asyncio.run(create_campaign())
```

as result the new campaign is returned use it as an object of reference to `object_id`. IF you need to query details about the campaign see the example below.
```python
async def get_campaign_by_id(id):
    try:
        campaign = await payarc.split_campaigns['retrieve'](id)
        print('Campaign retrieved:', campaign)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

asyncio.run(get_campaign_by_id('cmp_o3**********86n5'))
```


### Update campaign details

In case you need to update details of the campaign use `update` function. in the examples below you can reference campaign by id or as an object
```python
async def update_campaign():
    try:
        payload = {
                      'notes': "new version of notes"
                  }

        campaign = await payarc.split_campaigns['update']('cmp_o3maq0gklr78p6n5', payload)
        print('Campaign updated:', campaign)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

asyncio.run(update_campaign())
```

## Recurrent Payments Setup
Recurrent payments, also known as subscription billing, are essential for any service-based business that requires regular, automated billing of customers. By setting up recurrent payments through our SDK, you can offer your customers the ability to easily manage subscription plans, ensuring timely and consistent revenue streams. This setup involves creating subscription plans, managing customer subscriptions, and handling automated billing cycles. Below, we outline the steps necessary to integrate recurrent payments into your application using our SDK.

### Creating Subscription Plans
The first step in setting up recurrent payments is to create subscription plans. These plans define the billing frequency, pricing, and any trial periods or discounts. Using our SDK, you can create multiple subscription plans to cater to different customer needs. Here is an example of how to create a plan:
```python
async def create_plan():
    plan_data = {
        'name': 'Monthly billing regular',
        'amount': 999,
        'interval': 'month',
        'statement_descriptor': '2024 MerchantT. Rglr srvc'
    }
    try:
        plan = await payarc.billing['plan']['create'](plan_data)
        print('Plan created:', plan)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

asyncio.run(create_plan())
```
In this example a new plan is created in attribute `name` client friendly name of the plan must be provided. Attribute `amount` is number in cents. in `interval` you specify how often the request for charge will occurs. Information in `statement_descriptor` will be present in the reason for payment request. For more attributes and details check API documentation.

### Updating Subscription Plan
Once plan is created sometimes it is required details form it to be changed. The SDK allow you to manipulate object `plan` or to refer to the object by ID. here are examples how to change details of a plan:
```python
async def update_plan():
    try:
        plans = await payarc.billing['plan']['list']()
        plan = plans['plans'][0]
        if plan:
            updated_plan = await plan['update']({'name': 'Monthly billing regular II'})
            print('Plan updated:', updated_plan)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

asyncio.run(update_plan())
```
Update plan when know the ID
```python
async def update_plan_by_id(id):
    try:
        updated_plan = await payarc.billing['plan']['update'](id,
                                                              {
                                                                  'name': 'Monthly billing regular II'
                                                              }
                                                              )
        print('Plan updated:', updated_plan)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error
              )
asyncio.run(update_plan_by_id('plan_3aln*******8y8'))
```


### Creating Subscriptions
Once you have created subscription plans, the next step is to manage customer subscriptions. This involves subscribing customers to the plans they choose and managing their billing information. Our SDK makes it easy to handle these tasks. Here's how you can subscribe a customer to a plan:

#### Create a subscription over `plan` object
```python

async def create_subscription():
    try:
        plans = await payarc.billing['plan']['list']({'search': 'iron'})
        subscriber = {
            'customer_id': 'cus_DPNMVjx4AMNNVnjA',
        }
        plans = plans['plans']
        if plans:
            plan = plans[0]
            if plan:
                subscription = await plan['create_subscription'](subscriber)
                print('Subscription created:', subscription)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

asyncio.run(create_subscription())

```
#### # Create a subscription with plan id
```python
async def create_subscription_by_plan_id():
    try:
        subscriber = {
            'customer_id': 'cus_D**********njA',
        }
        subscription = await payarc.billing['plan']['create_subscription']('plan_3aln*******8y8', subscriber)
        print('Subscription created:', subscription)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(create_subscription_by_plan_id())
```
This code subscribes a customer to the premium plan using their saved payment method. The SDK handles the rest, including storing the subscription details and scheduling the billing cycle.


### Listing Subscriptions
To collect already created subscriptions you can use method `list` as in the example 
```python
async def list_subscription():
    try:
        subscriptions = await payarc.billing['plan']['subscription']['list']()
        print('Subscriptions:', subscriptions)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(list_subscription())
```

#### You can sent parameters to filter on result for example the quantity and the plan
```python
async def list_subscription_with_filter():
    try:
        subscriptions = await payarc.billing['plan']['subscription']['list']({'limit': 3, 'plan':'plan_7****f'})
        print('Subscriptions:', subscriptions)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(list_subscription_with_filter())
```

### Updating Subscription
To manipulate subscription SDK is providing few methods `update` and `cancel`, both can be used with identifier of subscription or over subscription object. Examples of their invocations:
#### Update subscription with ID
```python
async def update_subscription():
    try:
        subscription = await payarc.billing['plan']['subscription']['update']('sub_Vg0rxj00AVrjPAoX', {'description':'Monthly for VIP'})
        print('Subscription updated:', subscription)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(update_subscription())
```
#### Cancel subscription with ID
```python
async def cancel_subscription():
    try:
        subscription = await payarc.billing['plan']['subscription']['cancel']('sub_Vg0rxj00AVrjPAoX')
        print('Subscription canceled:', subscription)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)
        
asyncio.run(cancel_subscription())

A dispute in the context of payment processing refers to a situation where a cardholder questions the validity of a transaction that appears on their statement. This can lead to a chargeback, where the transaction amount is reversed from the merchant's account and credited back to the cardholder. A cardholder sees a transaction on their account that they believe is incorrect or unauthorized. This could be due to various reasons such as fraudulent activity, billing errors, or dissatisfaction with a purchase. The cardholder contacts their issuing bank to dispute the transaction. They may provide details on why they believe the transaction is invalid. The issuing bank investigates the dispute. This may involve gathering information from the cardholder and reviewing the transaction details. The issuing bank communicates the dispute to the acquiring bank (the merchant's bank) through the card network (in your case Payarc). The merchant is then required to provide evidence to prove the validity of the transaction, such as receipts, shipping information, or communication with the customer. Based on the evidence provided by both the cardholder and the merchant, the issuing bank makes a decision. If the dispute is resolved in favor of the cardholder, a chargeback occurs, and the transaction amount is deducted from the merchant's account and credited to the cardholder. If resolved in favor of the merchant, the transaction stands.
This documentation should help you understand how to use the Payarc SDK to manage charges and customers. If you have any questions, please refer to the Payarc API documentation or contact support.


### Inquiry Dispute 
The SDK provide a function to list your disputes. you can provide query parameters to specify the constraints over the function. when sent with no parameters it returns all disputes in the past one month
```python
async def list_cases():
    try:
        cases = await payarc.disputes['list']()
        print('Cases:', cases)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

asyncio.run(list_cases())
```


You can get details for a dispute by `retrieve` function. the identifier is returned by `list` function
```python
async def get_case(id):
    try:
        case = await payarc.disputes['retrieve'](id)
        print('Case:', case)
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error detected:', error)

asyncio.run(get_case('case_3aln*******8y8'))
```
### Submit Cases
In order to resolve the dispute in your(merchant's) flavour, the merchant is  required to provide evidence to prove the validity of the transaction, such as receipts, shipping information, or communication with the customer. The SDK provides a function `add_document` that allows you to provide files and write messages to prove that you have rights to keep the mony for the transaction. First parameter of this function is the identifier of the dispute for which the evidence is. Next parameter is an object with following attributes:
  - `DocumentDataBase64`: base46 representation of the files that will be used as evidence 
  - `text`: short text to describe the evidence
  - `mimeType`: type of the provided file
  - `message`: Description of submitted case
For more information for parameters and their attributes check documentation
```python
async def submit_case():
    document_base64 = "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"
