# Quick Start: Your First Agent in 5 Minutes! ‚è±Ô∏è

Ready for liftoff? This guide will get you running your first Flock agent faster than a hummingbird's wings! We'll create a simple agent that takes a topic and generates a fun presentation title and some slide headers.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you've completed the **[Installation](installation.md)** steps, especially setting up your LLM API keys in your environment (e.g., in a `.env` file).

## The "Hello Flock!" Code

Create a new Python file (e.g., `hello_flock.py`) and paste the following code:

```python
# hello_flock.py
from flock.core import Flock, DefaultAgent

# --------------------------------
# 1. Choose Your LLM
# --------------------------------
# Flock uses litellm, so you can specify many different providers.
# Make sure the corresponding API key is set in your environment!
# Examples: "openai/gpt-4o", "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229", "gemini/gemini-1.5-pro"
MODEL = "openai/gpt-4o" # <-- Replace with your preferred model if needed

# --------------------------------
# 2. Create Your Flock
# --------------------------------
# The Flock is the main orchestrator.
flock = Flock(
    name="presentation_helper",
    description="My first Flock!",
    model=MODEL # Set the default model for agents in this Flock
)

# --------------------------------
# 3. Define Your Agent Declaratively
# --------------------------------
# No complex prompts needed! Just declare what goes in and what comes out.
presentation_agent = DefaultAgent(
    name="my_presentation_agent",
    description="Creates a fun presentation outline about a given topic",
    input="topic: str", # The agent expects a string named 'topic'
    output="fun_title: str, fun_slide_headers: list[str]" # It will output a string 'fun_title' and a list of strings 'fun_slide_headers'
)

# --------------------------------
# 4. Add the Agent to the Flock
# --------------------------------
flock.add_agent(presentation_agent)

# --------------------------------
# 5. Run the Flock!
# --------------------------------
# Tell the Flock which agent to start with and provide the input.
print(f"Running agent '{presentation_agent.name}'...")
result = flock.run(
    agent=presentation_agent,  # Or use the name: "my_presentation_agent"
    input={"topic": "Why Llamas Make Great Urban Pets"}
)

# --------------------------------
# 6. Admire the Results!
# --------------------------------
# The result is a clean Python object (a Box object, behaves like a dict/object)
print("\n--- Agent Output ---")
print(f"‚ú® Title: {result.fun_title}")
print(f"üìä Headers: {result.fun_slide_headers}")
print("--------------------")
```

## Running the Code

Save the file and run it from your terminal:

`python hello_flock.py`


You should see output similar to this (the exact content will vary based on the LLM's response):

```bash
Running agent 'my_presentation_agent'...

--- Agent Output ---
‚ú® Title: Concrete Jungles & Camelids: Why Your Next Roommate Should Be A Llama
üìä Headers: ['Llamas: Nature's Low-Maintenance Loft-Dwellers', "Traffic Jam? No Prob-llama!", 'The Ultimate Urban Eco-Warrior (They Mow with Their Mouths!)', 'Spit Happens: Debunking Llama Myths', 'From Andes to Apartments: Integrating Your Llama Lifestyle']
--------------------
```

## What Just Happened?

Let's break down the magic:

**Choose Your LLM**: You specified which LLM to use via MODEL. litellm handles the connection using the API key from your environment.

**Create Your Flock**: The Flock object acts as the container and orchestrator for your agents.

**Define Your Agent Declaratively**: This is the core of Flock! Instead of writing a long prompt, you constructed a `DefaultAgent` and simply declared:

`input="topic: str"`: The agent needs one input called topic, which should be a string.

`output="fun_title: str, fun_slide_headers: list[str]"`: The agent should produce two outputs: fun_title (a string) and fun_slide_headers (a list of strings).
Flock's default evaluator takes care of constructing the necessary instructions for the LLM based on these declarations and the agent's description.

**Add the Agent**: You registered your presentation_agent with the flock.

**Run the Flock**: `flock.run()` kicked off the process, starting with your specified agent and input.

**Admire the Results**: Flock executed the agent (calling the LLM behind the scenes) and returned the output as a convenient Box object, allowing you to access the results using dot notation (like result.fun_title).

Congratulations! You've successfully run your first Flock agent without writing a single complex prompt.
