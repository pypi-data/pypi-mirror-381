# Contributing Guide üôå

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!  Flock is still early but we value outside input.  We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct.

---

## 1. Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repo & create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-thing`).
2. **Install** dev dependencies: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt && uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.
3. **Run tests**: `pytest -q` (they should pass before and after your change).
4. **Make changes** ‚Äì keep them atomic and well-documented.
5. **Lint & type-check**: `ruff .` and `mypy src/`.
6. **Commit** following *Conventional Commits* (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` etc.).
7. **Open a PR** against `main`.  Include a description, screenshots, and linked issues.

---


## 2. Reporting Issues:
* Before submitting a new issue, please check [existing issues](https://github.com/whiteducksoftware/flock/issues) if it has already been reported.
* To submit a new issue, please use the provided **Issue Templates** and provide a clear and descriptive title along with a detailed description of the problem or feature request, including steps to reproduce if it's a bug.

---

## 3. Docs Contributions

Docs live under `docs/` and are built with **MkDocs Material**.

```bash
mkdocs serve  # live-reload at http://localhost:8000
```

* Use American English.
* Keep sentences short; favour lists & tables.
* Add code blocks with triple-backticks and language.
* Good documentation is crucial for the usability of Flock. When adding or updating code, please also update the relevant documentation.
* Use clear, concise language and include examples where applicable. (On that note: If you want to, you may also provide an example for the [example showcase](https://github.com/whiteducksoftware/flock-showcase)
* Maintain consistency in formatting and style throughout the documentation.

---

## 4. Coding Standards

* Python `3.10+`.  Use type hints everywhere.
* Follow `ruff` default rules + `black` formatting.
* Keep imports sorted (`ruff format`).
* Write **async-friendly** code (non-blocking I/O).

---

## 5. Tests

* Place new tests in `tests/` mirroring the package path.
* Use `pytest` fixtures instead of duplicating setup code.
* For Temporal code, rely on the *Temporal Test Server* fixture.
* Test your changes thoroughly! Ensure that existing tests pass and add **new tests** for any new functionality.
* Follow Flock's testing conventions and use the provided testing framework.
* Run the tests before submitting your pull request to confirm that nothing is broken.

---

## 6. Pull Requests: 
- Ensure your code is well-tested and adheres to the Coding-Standards.
- Write clear commit messages that explain the changes made.
- Clearly outline and communicate breaking API-changes.
- Before submitting a pull request, make sure your branch is up to date with the base branch (`main`) of the [main repository](https://github.com/whiteducksoftware/flock).
- Open a pull request with a summary of your changes and any relevant issue numbers.
