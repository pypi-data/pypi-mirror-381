        use `server` (type FlockMCPServer) to modify the core behavior of the server.
        use `additional_params` to 'tack_on' additional configurations (for example additional headers for sse-clients.)

        (For example: modify the server's config)
        new_config = NewConfigObject(...)
        server.config = new_config

        Warning:
            Be very careful when modifying a server's internal state.
            If you just need to 'tack on' additional information (such as headers)
            or want to temporarily override certain configurations (such as timeouts)
            use `additional_params` instead if you can.

        (Or pass additional values downstream:)
        additional_params["headers"] = { "Authorization": "Bearer 123" }
        additional_params["read_timeout_seconds"] = 100


        Note:
            `additional_params` resets between mcp_calls.
            so there is not persistence between individual calls.
            This choice has been made to allow developers to
            dynamically switch configurations.
            (This can be used, for example, to use a module to inject oauth headers for
            individual users on a call-to-call basis. this also gives you direct control over
            managing the headers yourself. For example, checking for lifetimes on JWT-Tokens.)

        Note:
            you can access `additional_params` when you are implementing your own subclasses of
            FlockMCPClientManager and FlockMCPClient. (with self.additional_params.)

        keys which are processed for `additional_params` in the flock core code are:
        --- General ---

        "refresh_client": bool -> defaults to False. Indicates whether or not to restart a connection on a call. (can be used when headers oder api-keys change to automatically switch to a new client.)
        "read_timeout_seconds": float -> How long to wait for a connection to happen.

        --- SSE ---

        "override_headers": bool -> default False. If set to false, additional headers will be appended, if set to True, additional headers will override existing ones.
        "headers": dict[str, Any] -> Additional Headers injected in sse-clients and ws-clients
        "sse_read_timeout_seconds": float -> how long until a connection is being terminated for sse-clients.
        "url": str -> which url the server listens on (allows switching between mcp-servers with modules.)

        --- Stdio ---

        "command": str -> Command to run for stdio-servers.
        "args": list[str] -> additional paramters for stdio-servers.
        "env": dict[str, Any] -> Environment-Variables for stdio-servers.
        "encoding": str -> Encoding to use when talking to stdio-servers.
        "encoding-error-handler": str -> Encoding error handler to use when talking to stdio-servers.

        --- Websockets ---

        "url": str -> Which url the server listens on (allows switching between mcp-servers with modules.)
