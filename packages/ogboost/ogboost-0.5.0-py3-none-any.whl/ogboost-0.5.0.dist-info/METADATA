# Gradient Boosting for Ordinal Regression (GBOR)

`gbor` is a scikit-learn-compatible, Python package designed for gradient boosting tailored to ordinal regression problems. It does so by alternating between fitting a base learner - `GradientBoostingRegressor`, by default - to predict a latent score that specifies the mean of a cumulative density function for the observed discrete outcomes, and fitting a set of thresholds that convert the latent score to the discrete outcome. It can be viewed as coordinate-descent optimization that combines functional gradient descent (the boosting stage) with ordinary gradient descent (for adjusting thresholds).

The main class in the package, `GradientBoostingOrdinal`, supports custom link functions, sample weighting, early stopping criteria, and staged predictions. In addition to methods for predicting class labels and probabilities, similar to nominal classifiers, the `decision_function` method of the class predicts the latent score, which can be used to achieve superior performance in discreiminative/ranking tasks.

## Features
- Fully compatible with scikit-learn pipelines.
- Customizable link functions: Probit, Logit, and Complementary Log-Log.
- Supports sample weighting for robust handling of imbalanced datasets.
- Subsampling for stochastic gradient boosting.
- Early stopping based on validation loss.
- Utilities for data loading and evaluation metrics.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the package:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gbor.git
cd gbor
pip install .
```

## Quick Start
### Load the Wine Quality Dataset
The package includes a utility to load the wine quality dataset from the UCI repository.

```python
from gbor.data import load_wine_quality

# Load data
red_wine, white_wine = load_wine_quality()
X = red_wine.drop(columns="quality")
y = red_wine["quality"]
```

### Train a Gradient Boosting Ordinal Model
```python
from gbor.main import GradientBoostingOrdinal

# Initialize and fit the model
model = GradientBoostingOrdinal(n_estimators=100, link_function='logit', verbose=1)
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict class labels and probabilities
predicted_labels = model.predict(X)
predicted_probabilities = model.predict_proba(X)

# Evaluate using the concordance index
from gbor.main import concordance_index
c_index = concordance_index(y, model.decision_function(X))
print(f"Concordance Index: {c_index:.3f}")
```
