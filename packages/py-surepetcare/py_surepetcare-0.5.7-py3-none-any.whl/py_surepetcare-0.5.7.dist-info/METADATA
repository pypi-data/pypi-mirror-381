# SurePetcare API Client

This repository provides a Python client for accessing the [SurePetcare API](https://app-api.beta.surehub.io/index.html?urls.primaryName=V1).  

The project is inspired by [benleb/surepy](https://github.com/benleb/surepy), but aims for improved separation of concerns between classes, making it easier to extend and support the production, v1 and v2 SurePetcare API.
