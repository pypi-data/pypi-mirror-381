# nbnorm

a convenience tool to do mass notebook normalization

initially developped for https://github.com/flotpython/course,
and initially located in https://github.com/flotpython/tools,
but substantially modified later on.

**WARNING**: this is a moving target as it gets hacked along upon our current needs, not supposed to be a stable tool.
