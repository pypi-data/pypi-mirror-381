# MASTSEL

This library was developed with 2 goals: support the Asterism Selection for
MAVIS instrument (https://mavis-ao.org/) and managing the computation of the
jitter (i.e. tip/tilt) error in Adaptive Optics simulations done in the Fourier
domain. It is used by TIPTOP (https://github.com/astro-tiptop/TIPTOP).

The main features are located in:

- `mastsel/mavisLO.py` class that computes the jitter ellipses that can be
  convolved with High Orders (HO, i.e. aberrations of higher spatial
  frequencies than tip/tilt) Point Spread Functions (PSF) to get the PSFs that
  consider both the effect of HO and Low Orders (LO, i.e. tip/tilt).

- `mastsel/mavisPsf.py` that contains a set of methods and classes to compute
  short and long exposure PSF from Power Spectral Densities (PSD), Strehl
  Ratios, radial profiles, encircled energies (and other quantities) from PSF,
  to convolve kernels with PSFs, …
