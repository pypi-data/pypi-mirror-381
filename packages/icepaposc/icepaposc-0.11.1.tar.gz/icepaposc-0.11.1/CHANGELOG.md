# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.11.x]

### Added
 - Basic pytest-qt tests.
 - New options: -sr sample_rate and -dr dump_rate
 - New signals to simplify encoder testing ([ein/inp/sync][pos/aux]).

### Removed

### Fixed
* Fix deprecation warning: `UserWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API.`
 
## [0.10.4]

### Added
 - Reset X button is overloaded and switches behaviour between autopan and 
 autoscale. 
 - Reset Y button is overloaded and switches now behaviour between 'autoscale 
 all y axes' and 'divide vertical space between yaxes and setRange 
 accordingly' (try yourself).
 - The hotkeys are now available via icepaposc -h
 - Add Encmeasure method 
 

### Removed

### Fixed
- Fixed signal sets from command line and dialog
- Hotkeys arranged to match ipaptrend. See –help
- Autorangex/autopanx switch
- Autorangey/autorange_y_tiled(split viewbox vertically)
- Other minor fixes
- Ysplitview feature modification to use up space better vertically
- Fix long description
- Use pos instead of fpos to read posmeasure, difaxmeasure

## [0.9.0]

### Added

 - The option to define curves from the command line (--sig) was not working 
 and now is fixed. 
 - The option to define curves from a file (--sigset) was not working and 
   now is fixed 
 - 2 more vertical axes are available to allow for more flexibility with 
   the autoranging when curves have too different ranges 
 - Scale and offset factors apply to all the acquired data (and not to only 
   from the point in time where they are set as before)
 - Scale and offset factors can be set from the command line call (--corr)
 - Ctrl+U allows to toggle whether the scale/offset factors are applied or not 
 - Measure curve differences between two points in time. Double click in 
   the graph fixes a second crosshair time location. Difference in the 
   curves between that crosshair and the crosshair that follows the mouse 
   are displayed in the top legend. 
 - Local min/max in the legend. The time range for the min/max curve values 
   in the legend is set by default to all acquired data. The time range can 
   be set to a local range by the following sequence: double-click as 
   described above to fix a cross-hair to one of the range-limits. Then 
   click on the time location for the other range. The min/max values in 
   the legend are updated for that local range only. A new click in the 
   data widget will reset the time range to all the acquired data. 
 - Ctrl+O allows to save directly to csv, the data within the time range 
   shown in the display (min/max in the legend are updated to that time 
   range as well). 
 - Ctrl+I allows to define a text string added to the name of the .csv file 
   saved via Ctrl+O 
 - Ctrl+A/Z/E load several predefined curves sets (experimental)
