# Tof


## About

A simple tool to create time-of-flight chopper cascade diagrams

**Scope:**

- ``tof`` is designed to be simple and lightweight, it will never replace [McStas](https://www.mcstas.org/)
- it assumes all neutrons travel in a straight line
- it does not simulate absorption or scattering effects

## Installation

```sh
python -m pip install tof
```
