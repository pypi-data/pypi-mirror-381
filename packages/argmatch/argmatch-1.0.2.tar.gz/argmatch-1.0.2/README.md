## More robust tests

Python's [mocking library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html) (or its [backport](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock) for Python <3.3) is simple, reliable, and easy to use.
But it is also a little lacking when it comes to asserting what calls a mock has received.

You can be either very specific::

    my_mock.assert_called_once_with(42, some_foo_object, 'certain string')

or extremely general::

    my_mock.assert_called_with(ANY, ANY, ANY)
    # passes as long as argument count is the same

| The former can make your tests over-specified, and thus fragile.
| The latter could make them too broad, missing some erroneous cases and possibly letting your code fail in production.

---

_argmatch_ provides **argument matchers** that allow you to be exactly as precise as you want::

    my_mock.assert_called_with(GreaterThan(0), InstanceOf(Foo), String())

without tedious, handcrafted, and poorly readable code that checks `call_args` or `call_args_list`::

    self.assertGreater(mock.call_args[0][0], 0)
    self.assertIsInstance(mock.call_args[0][1], Foo)
    self.assertIsInstance(mock.call_args[0][2], str)

It has plenty of matcher types to fit all common and uncommon needs, and you can easily write your own if necessary.

Installation

```

Installing *argmatch* is easy with pip::

    $ pip install argmatch

| *argmatch* support goes all the way back to Python 2.6.
| It also works both with the ``unittest.mock`` module from Python 3.3+ or its backport.
