# PyMosquitto

A lightweight Python MQTT client implemented as a thin wrapper around libmosquitto.

It provides an efficient synchronous client (`client.Client`) and two variants of asynchronous clients:

- `aio.AsyncClient` - async interface to libmosquitto loop running in its own thread. It's faster, but consumes a little bit more memory.
- `aio.TrueAsyncClient` - manages all events in asyncio loop by utilizing `mosquitto_loop_{read,write,misc}` functions.


## Dependencies

- python3.8+
- libmosquitto1


## Installation

- pip install pymosquitto


## Usage

```python
from pymosquitto import Client


def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print(msg)


client = Client()
client.on_connect = lambda *_: client.subscribe("#", 1)
client.on_message = on_message
client.connect_async("localhost", 1883)
client.loop_forever()
```

Async client example:

```python
import asyncio

from pymosquitto.aio import AsyncClient


async def main():
    async with AsyncClient() as client:
        await client.connect("localhost", 1883)
        await client.subscribe("#", 1)
        async for msg in client.read_messages():
            print(msg)


asyncio.run(main())
```
