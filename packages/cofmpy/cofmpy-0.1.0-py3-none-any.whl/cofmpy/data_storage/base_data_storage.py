    Base class for data storages.

    Data storages are used to save and load data. The data storage can be a file, a
    database, a cloud storage, etc. Each data storage subclass must implement the
    `save`, `load`, and `delete` methods.

    The data storage is initialized with a configuration dictionary that contains the
    necessary parameters to connect to the storage. The configuration dictionary must
    contain a `type` key that corresponds to the `type_name` class attribute of the data
    storage subclass. The configuration dictionary also contains a `config` key with the
    parameters to initialize the data storage.

    The data storage class also contains a registry of available data storages. The
    subclasses must be registered in the registry using the `register_data_storage`
    class method.
