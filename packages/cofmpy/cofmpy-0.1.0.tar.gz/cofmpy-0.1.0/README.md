## üëã About CoFMPy

CoFMPy is a Python library designed for rapid prototyping of digital twins through 
the co-simulation of Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs).
It offers advanced master coordination features, such as solving algebraic loops between
FMUs and managing the interaction between various simulation components. This library
provides a seamless interface to orchestrate complex physics simulations and handle the
data exchange between FMUs.

The documentation is available online: https://irt-saint-exupery.github.io/CoFMPy/

## üêæ Installation

CoFMPy is available on PyPI and can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install cofmpy
```

## üêç Python interface

The Python interface allows users to use CoFMPy and run co-simulation. A high-level
API is provided to easily run and visualize a co-simulation system.
Advanced users can also dive deeper into the structure of CoFMPy for a more advanced
control of the components.

Under the hood, CoFMPy is controlled by a component called the _Coordinator_. It is the
entry point of CoFMPy and it manages all the other components:

- the Master algorithm which is the engine that runs the co-simulation of FMUs.
- the Graph Engine that builds the connections and interactions between the FMUs and the
  data sources and sinks.
- the data stream handlers that control the input data required by the co-simulation
  system.
- the data storages that allow to store or send the outputs of the simulation.

## üìú JSON configuration file

To properly define the co-simulation system, a JSON configuration file must be created.
This file is the only information required by CoFMPy to run the simulation. It must
respect a specific syntax in order to define the FMUs, the interactions between them,
the data sources and sinks, etc.
