This package contains primitive types used across OFRAK packages, including:

- `Range`, an object used to represent a range of integers. Especially common when representing memory ranges.
- `InstructionSet`, `SubInstructionSet`, `InstructionSetMode`, and `Processor`, enum classes representing various architecture information.
- `BitWidth` and `Endianness` for indicating data representations.
- `NotFoundError`, `AlreadyExistError`, `InvalidStateError`, and `InvalidUsageError`, which each represent a general type of error not covered by Python's built in exception classes.
- `MemoryPermissions`, an enum class of memory access permissions R, W, X, and valid combinations of such.
