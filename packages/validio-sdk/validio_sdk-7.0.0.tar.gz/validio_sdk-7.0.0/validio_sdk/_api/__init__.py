"""
**NOTE**
This API SDK is prefixed with `_` because it's **internal**.

The API SDK is used to back Validio CLI tool and Validio IaC but there are _no
guarantees_ about stability of this code. Breaking changes can and will happen
at any time!

It is highly recommended that you write and maintain your own API SDK to work
with Validio API.
