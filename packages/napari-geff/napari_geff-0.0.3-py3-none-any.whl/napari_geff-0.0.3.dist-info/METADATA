## Installation

You can install `napari-geff` via [pip]:

```
pip install napari-geff
```

If napari is not already installed, you can install `napari-geff` with napari and Qt via:

```
pip install "napari-geff[all]"
```

## Usage

`napari-geff` supports loading directed graphs stored as [GEFF](https://live-image-tracking-tools.github.io/geff/latest/) files into
`napari` as `Tracks` layers, and saving them back out to GEFF format.

To use `napari-geff` after installation, simply drag a GEFF file into the viewer and select `GEFF IO` from the
plugin selection dialog, if required. The file will be loaded as a `Tracks` layer.

Any node properties defined on your graph will be stored as features on your tracks layer. Edge properties
will be available under `layer.metadata['edge_properties']` as a dictionary, but cannot currently be displayed
or used for visualization in `napari`.

If your file contains `image` or `labels` related objects as per the GEFF
[spec](https://live-image-tracking-tools.github.io/geff/v0.4.0/specification/#geff_related_objects),
these will also be loaded alongside your `Tracks` layer.

If you wish to open your geff file into layers **programmatically**, you can do so using the `viewer.open` method:

```python
import napari
path = 'path/to/top_level_zarr.zarr/my-geff-group/

viewer = napari.Viewer()
layers = viewer.open(path, plugin='napari-geff')
```
