This module allows you to configure domains to filter projects and tasks available for selection in helpdesk tickets, reducing errors and improving efficiency.

## Key Benefits

- **Automated Filtering:** Configure domains to show only relevant projects and tasks for each team
- **Error Reduction:** Minimize manual selection errors by limiting available options
- **Smart Task Filtering:** Tasks are automatically filtered by the selected project
- **Flexible Configuration:** Use static domains or dynamic Python code for complex rules

## Main Use Cases

### Project Filtering
- Show only active projects
- Filter by client/partner
- Separate internal from external projects
- Filter by project tags or categories

### Task Filtering
- Show only tasks from selected project
- Filter by assignment status (assigned/unassigned)
- Filter by priority or urgency
- Filter by task tags or phases

### Advanced Rules
