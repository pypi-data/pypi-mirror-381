## About ##

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural
networks. Later NEAT was extended to evolve CT (Continuous Time) networks in different frameworks.
This project is a Python implementation of CT-NEAT (and has both pure NEAT and CT-NEAT implementations) with few dependencies beyond the standard library (like scikit-learn). It was
forked from the excellent project started by @MattKallada and continued by @CodeReclaimers ([neat-python](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python?tab=readme-ov-file)) after their project was archived.

For further information regarding general concepts and theory, please see the 
[Selected Publications](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#publications) on Stanley's page at the University of Central 
Florida (now somewhat dated), or the [publications page](https://www.kenstanley.net/papers) of his current website. (rtNEAT would be relevant for the CT element.)

`ct-neat-python` is licensed under the [3-clause BSD license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).  It is
currently supported on Python 3.8 through 3.13, and pypy3.

## Getting Started ##
If you want to try ct-neat-python, please check out the repository, start playing with the examples (`examples/xor` is
a good place to start) and then try creating your own experiment.

The package can be install from PyPI using:
```
pip install ct-neat-python
```

The documentation is available on [Read The Docs](https://ct-neat-python.readthedocs.io).

If you want to contribute to the directory and run the code in a developer setting, run the following from the root of the project:
```
pip install -e .
```
This will install the package in a dynamically linked mode such that all of your changes will be immediately reflected.
