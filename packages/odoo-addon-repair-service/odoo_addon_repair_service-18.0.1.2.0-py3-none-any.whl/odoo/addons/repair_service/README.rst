This module introduces repair services. It adds a new "Services" tab in
the repair orders, where users can add and manage services associated
with the repair. Once the repair order is confirmed and a sale order is
created, these services can be automatically added as sale order lines.
Moreover, if the repair order has the "Under Warranty" field checked,
the module ensures that the corresponding sale order lines price are set
to a value of 0, reflecting the warranty coverage.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This functionality is similar to the "Operations" tab that existed in
previous versions in core Odoo. This tab allowed users to manage
services and operations in the repair orders. This module reintroduces
that functionality and adds these services as sale order lines when the
sale order is generated.

Usage
=====

When creating or editing a repair order, you will find a new "Services"
tab within the repair order form. In this tab, you can input and manage
the services performed as part of the repair order. Once the repair
order is confirmed, when you creating a sale order from the repair
order, the services listed in the "Services" tab will be automatically
added as sale order lines.
