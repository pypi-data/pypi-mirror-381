This module introduces repair services. It adds a new "Services" tab in the repair orders, where users can add and manage services associated with the repair. Once the repair order is confirmed and a sale order is created, these services can be automatically added as sale order lines. Moreover, if the repair order has the "Under Warranty" field checked, the module ensures that the corresponding sale order lines price are set to a value of 0, reflecting the warranty coverage.
