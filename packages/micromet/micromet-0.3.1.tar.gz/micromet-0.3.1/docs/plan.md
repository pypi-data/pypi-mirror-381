# MicroMet Project Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the MicroMet project based on an analysis of the current codebase, documentation, and project requirements. MicroMet is a Python package for processing micrometeorological data from environmental monitoring stations, particularly focused on processing Eddy Covariance data from Campbell Scientific CR6 dataloggers for submission to the Ameriflux Data Portal.

The plan addresses key areas for improvement including code organization, testing, documentation, performance, code quality, feature enhancements, and project management. Each section provides a rationale for the proposed changes and specific action items.

## Project Goals and Constraints

### Primary Goals

1. **Data Processing**: Efficiently process half-hourly Eddy Covariance data from Campbell Scientific CR6 dataloggers running EasyFluxDL
2. **Data Formatting**: Ensure data conforms to Ameriflux's formatting standards
3. **Quality Assurance**: Provide tools for QA/QC of processed data
4. **Data Reprocessing**: Support manual reprocessing of low-quality datasets
5. **Data Submission**: Facilitate uploading refined data to Ameriflux

### Constraints

1. **Compatibility**: Must work with existing Campbell Scientific CR6 dataloggers and EasyFluxDL software
2. **Standards Compliance**: Must adhere to Ameriflux data formatting standards
3. **Python Environment**: Requires Python >=3.11 and specific dependencies
4. **Dual-CR6 Setup**: Must support Utah Flux Network stations' dual-CR6 setup (one for EasyFluxDL, one for redundant meteorological data)

## Code Organization and Architecture

### Current State
The codebase currently lacks consistent organization, with some modules (particularly `converter.py`) being too large and containing too many responsibilities. Imports are not standardized, error handling is inconsistent, and configuration management is scattered throughout the code.

### Improvement Plan
1. **Modular Restructuring**: Break down large modules (especially `converter.py` at 920 lines) into smaller, focused modules with clear responsibilities
   - Rationale: Smaller modules are easier to understand, test, and maintain
   - Action: Split `converter.py` into logical components (e.g., `data_parser.py`, `formatter.py`, `validator.py`)

2. **Clean Import Strategy**: Refactor package imports in `__init__.py` to avoid wildcard imports and explicitly import only what's needed
   - Rationale: Explicit imports improve code readability and prevent namespace pollution
   - Action: Replace `from .module import *` with explicit imports of required classes and functions

3. **Consistent Error Handling**: Implement a unified error handling strategy across all modules
   - Rationale: Consistent error handling improves debugging and user experience
   - Action: Define custom exception classes and implement try-except blocks with appropriate error messages

4. **Centralized Configuration**: Create a configuration management system to centralize configuration handling
   - Rationale: Centralized configuration reduces duplication and makes changes easier to implement
   - Action: Implement a configuration class that loads settings from a standard location

5. **API Standardization**: Standardize function signatures and return types across the codebase
   - Rationale: Consistent APIs make the library more intuitive to use
   - Action: Review all public functions and ensure they follow a consistent pattern

6. **Proper Logging**: Replace print statements with a structured logging system
   - Rationale: Proper logging facilitates debugging and monitoring
   - Action: Implement Python's logging module throughout the application

7. **Class Refactoring**: Refactor the `Reformatter` class to use composition instead of having many methods
   - Rationale: Composition improves maintainability and testability
   - Action: Break down the class into smaller, focused classes with single responsibilities

8. **Layer Separation**: Create clear separation between data access, processing, and visualization layers
   - Rationale: Separation of concerns improves maintainability and flexibility
   - Action: Reorganize code to separate data retrieval, processing logic, and visualization

## Testing

### Current State
The project has limited test coverage, with tests not organized to match the module structure. There are few integration tests and no performance benchmarks.

### Improvement Plan
1. **Test Organization**: Reorganize test files to match the module structure (one test file per module)
   - Rationale: Organized tests are easier to maintain and ensure comprehensive coverage
   - Action: Create a test file for each module with a consistent naming convention

2. **Coverage Increase**: Significantly increase test coverage for all modules
   - Rationale: Higher test coverage ensures code reliability and prevents regressions
   - Action: Write unit tests for all public functions and classes, aiming for at least 80% coverage

3. **Integration Testing**: Add integration tests that test the full data processing pipeline
   - Rationale: Integration tests verify that components work together correctly
   - Action: Create end-to-end tests that process sample data through the entire workflow

4. **Property-Based Testing**: Implement property-based testing for data transformation functions
   - Rationale: Property-based tests can find edge cases that manual tests might miss
   - Action: Use libraries like Hypothesis to generate test cases for data processing functions

5. **Edge Case Testing**: Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
   - Rationale: Edge case testing improves robustness and error handling
   - Action: Identify potential edge cases (e.g., missing data, malformed input) and write tests for them

6. **Continuous Integration**: Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
   - Rationale: CI ensures tests are run consistently and catches issues early
   - Action: Configure GitHub Actions or another CI service to run tests on every push

7. **Performance Benchmarks**: Add performance benchmarks for critical data processing functions
   - Rationale: Benchmarks help identify performance regressions
   - Action: Create benchmarks for key functions and track performance over time
