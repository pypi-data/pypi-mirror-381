About the Utah Flux Network
===========================

The Utah Flux Network (UFN) is a statewide hydrometeorological network established by the Utah Geological Survey (UGS) to measure evapotranspiration, an essential component of Utah's water budget. UFN uses **eddy covariance** and **surface renewal** techniques to monitor water vapor, CO₂, and energy fluxes.



Goals
-----
- Provide ground-truth data for satellite evapotranspiration estimates
- Support water banking, drought planning, and climate modeling
- Enable consumptive use analysis for the Colorado River Compact

Stations
--------
- Agricultural fields (e.g., Bluff, Wellington, Escalante, Dugout Ranch, Pelican Lake, Desert View, Green River)
- Wetlands (e.g., Matheson Wetlands, Great Salt Lake Phragmites)
- Salt flats (e.g., Bonneville Salt Flats)
- Forests (e.g., Cedar Mesa)

Measurements
------------
- Net radiation, soil heat flux, latent & sensible heat
- CO₂, water vapor, wind speed/direction
- Soil moisture, temperature, and precipitation
- Air temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure

Data Access
-----------
- Data is available through the `UGS website <https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/maps/interactive-maps/utah-flux-network/>`_, Mesowest, and the `Ameriflux website <https://ameriflux.lbl.gov>`_.
