# HG Systematic

This is a library of utilities and examples to highlight how HGraph can be used to implement
systematic trading strategies.


See [this](https://hgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.

## Development

The project is currently configured to make use of [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management. 
Take a look at the website to see how best to install the tool.

Here are some useful commands:

First, this will cause the virtual environment to be installed in the same folder as the project (in .venv folder)

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Use this command to set the version of Python to make use of if you want a specific version of Python.

```bash
poetry env use 3.12
```

Then use the following command to install the project and its dependencies. Note that the ``--with docs`` installs
the dependencies to build the documentation set which is not required otherwise, also the ``--all-extras`` is only
required for the adaptors.

```bash
poetry install --with docs --all-extras
```

If you did not use the first command, you can find the location of the installation using:

```bash
poetry env info
```

PyCharm can make use of poetry to ``setup`` the project.

### Run Tests

```bash
# No Coverage
poetry run pytest
```

```bash
# Generate Coverage Report
poetry run pytest --cov=your_package_name --cov-report=xml
```
