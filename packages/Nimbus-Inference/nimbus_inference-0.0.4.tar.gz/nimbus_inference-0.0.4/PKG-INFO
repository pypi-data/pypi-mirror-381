# Nimbus Inference

**Nimbus** is a deep learning model for automated classification of marker expression in multiplexed imaging data. This repository provides code for:
- **Inference** of the Nimbus model on your multiplexed images.
- **Finetuning** the Nimbus model on new data if desired.
- **Interactive exploration** of the Nimbus Gold Standard dataset.

The code for training the Nimbus model from scratch can be found in the [angelolab/Nimbus](https://github.com/angelolab/Nimbus) repository 

> **Installation (via pip)**  
> ```bash
> pip install Nimbus-Inference
> ```
> Create a Python environment with version 3.9–3.11, then install as shown above.

## Example Notebooks

We provide three Jupyter notebooks (in the `templates` folder), each with its own **example dataset** that is loaded from the Hugging Face Hub within the notebook:

- **[1_Nimbus_Predict.ipynb](https://github.com/angelolab/Nimbus-Inference/blob/main/templates/1_Nimbus_Predict.ipynb)**  
   - Guides you through performing inference with the Nimbus model on multiplexed imaging data.  
   - [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k-KnuALBRXbjbkpIP63tf7aEEALw9L1O/view?usp=sharing)  
     
- **[2_Nimbus_Finetuning.ipynb](https://github.com/angelolab/Nimbus-Inference/blob/main/templates/2_Nimbus_Finetuning.ipynb)**  
   - Shows you how to finetune the Nimbus model on a new dataset.

- **[3_interactive_viewer.ipynb](https://github.com/angelolab/Nimbus-Inference/blob/main/templates/3_interactive_viewer.ipynb)**  
   - Lets you interactively explore the Nimbus Gold Standard labeled dataset.  
   - [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LW0vHC3sKKA3TyvW_9FeIaHj3PonzhGS/view?usp=sharing)

Each notebook loads an example dataset directly from the Hugging Face Hub, so you can get hands-on with Nimbus right away.

## Datasets

We have released two main datasets on the Hugging Face Hub:

1. **Pan-Multiplex**  
   - A large, noisy labeled dataset used for training and validation.  
   - [https://huggingface.co/datasets/JLrumberger/Pan-Multiplex](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JLrumberger/Pan-Multiplex)

2. **Pan-Multiplex Gold-Standard**  
   - A smaller subset of Pan-Multiplex where every cell was manually annotated by experts.  
   - [https://huggingface.co/datasets/JLrumberger/Pan-Multiplex-Gold-Standard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JLrumberger/Pan-Multiplex-Gold-Standard)

## What is Nimbus?

Nimbus is a deep learning model designed to make **human-like, visual classifications** of multiplexed imaging data by determining which protein markers each cell is positive or negative for. Unlike many existing workflows, Nimbus:
- Uses the **raw image** pixels (rather than purely integrated intensity) to classify marker expression.
- Generalizes across many tissue types, imaging platforms, and markers — without retraining.
- Can be integrated into downstream clustering or phenotyping pipelines to improve accuracy.

## Repository organization

Our github is organized as follows: 
- The `README` file (which you're looking at now) provides an overview of the project
- The `.github` folder contains code automating jobs via github actions for testing and deployment
- The `assets` folder contains images that are displayed in the README
- The `docs` folder allows us to build and maintain updated documentation for the project
- The `src` folder contains the core code for running Nimbus
- The `templates` folder contains example notebooks to provide easy starting examples for new users
- The `tests` folder contains code for testing the codebase
  
For a more detailed look on how to get started, please check out our [documentation](https://nimbus-inference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
