# Data reconciliation

These notebook demonstrate _data reconciliation_, which uses mass and energy balances along with redundant measurements to improve data quality by:

1. reducing measurement error,
2. ensuring measurements satisfy mass and energy balances, and
3. filling in unmeasured quantities.

Data reconciliation is used to refine process data before parameter estimation.
