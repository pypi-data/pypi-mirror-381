# comfy-proxy

A Python client library for interacting with ComfyUI servers and managing image generation workflows.

## Features

- Single and multi-instance ComfyUI server management
- Async workflow execution
- Flexible address configuration (single, multiple, port ranges)
- Built-in workflow templates
- Customizable image sizes and parameters
- Websocket-based image generation and retrieval

## Installation

ComfyProxy requires Python 3.11 or later. Install using pip:

```bash
pip install comfy-proxy
```

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from comfy_proxy.comfy import SingleComfy
from comfy_proxy.workflows.flux import FluxModel, FluxWorkflowParams, FluxWorkflow
from comfy_proxy.workflow import Sizes

async def generate_image():
    # Initialize a ComfyUI instance
    comfy = Comfy("127.0.0.1:7821")
    
    # Configure model and parameters
    model = FluxModel()
    params = FluxWorkflowParams(
        prompt="a beautiful sunset over mountains",
        model=model,
        size=Sizes.LANDSCAPE_16_9,
        seed=42,
        batch_size=1
    )
    
    # Create and execute workflow
    workflow = FluxWorkflow(params)
    async for image_data in comfy.generate(workflow):
        with open("generated_image.png", "wb") as f:
            f.write(image_data)
        break  # Save first image only

# Run the example
asyncio.run(generate_image())
```

## Multiple ComfyUI Instances

ComfyProxy can distribute work across multiple ComfyUI servers:

```python
from comfy_proxy.comfy import Comfy

# Initialize with multiple instances
comfy = Comfy("127.0.0.1:8188-8192")  # Port range
# or
comfy = Comfy(["127.0.0.1:8188", "127.0.0.1:8189"])  # List
# or
comfy = Comfy("127.0.0.1:8188,127.0.0.1:8189")  # Comma-separated
```

## Development

Requirements:
- Python 3.11+
- Poetry for dependency management

Setup:
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/comfy-proxy.git
cd comfy-proxy

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run tests
poetry run pytest
```

## Built-In Workflows

- Flux t2i
- Wan 2.2 i2v (first frame, first+last frame, lightning)
- Qwen Image (regular, lightning)
- Qwen Image Edit 2509 (regular, lightning)

These correspond roughly to the default ComfyUI workflows and should be highly compatible.

## Custom Workflows

ComfyProxy comes with some built-in workflows (like `FluxWorkflow`), but you can easily create your own:

```python
from comfy_proxy.workflow import ComfyWorkflow, ComfyNode

class MyCustomWorkflow(ComfyWorkflow):
    def __init__(self, params):
        super().__init__()
        self.params = params
        self._build_workflow()
        
    def _build_workflow(self):
        # Add nodes to create your workflow
        checkpoint_node = self.add_node(
            "CheckpointLoaderSimple",
            {"ckpt_name": "sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors"}
        )
        # ... add more nodes and connect them
```

We welcome contributions of basic workflows for popular models:
- Stable Diffusion 1.5
- SDXL
- SD Turbo
- SD 3.0
- etc.

For more complex use cases, you can implement the `ComfyWorkflow` class directly in your own codebase to create custom workflows with additional functionality.
