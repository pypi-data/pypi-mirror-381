              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

## 🔧 Usage

### Reading Parquet Metadata

Rugo provides blazing-fast access to Parquet file metadata without the overhead of loading actual data:

```python
import rugo.parquet as parquet_meta

# Extract complete metadata from a Parquet file
metadata = parquet_meta.read_metadata("example.parquet")

print(f"Number of rows: {metadata['num_rows']}")
print(f"Number of row groups: {len(metadata['row_groups'])}")

# Analyze row groups and column statistics
for i, row_group in enumerate(metadata['row_groups']):
    print(f"Row Group {i}:")
    print(f"  Rows: {row_group['num_rows']}")
    print(f"  Size: {row_group['total_byte_size']} bytes")
    
    for col in row_group['columns']:
        print(f"    Column: {col['name']}")
        print(f"    Physical Type: {col['type']}")
        print(f"    Logical Type: {col.get('logical_type', '(none)')}")
        print(f"    Nulls: {col['null_count']}")
        print(f"    Min: {col['min']}")
        print(f"    Max: {col['max']}")
        
        # Check for bloom filter availability
        if parquet_meta.has_bloom_filter(col):
            print(f"    Has bloom filter: Yes")
        else:
            print(f"    Has bloom filter: No")
```

### Advanced Features

#### Schema Analysis

Extract detailed schema information including both physical and logical types:

```python
import rugo.parquet as parquet_meta

metadata = parquet_meta.read_metadata("example.parquet")
for col in metadata['row_groups'][0]['columns']:
    print(f"{col['name']}: {col['type']} -> {col.get('logical_type', '(inferred)')}")
    # Example output:
    # name: BYTE_ARRAY -> STRING
    # timestamp: INT64 -> TIMESTAMP_MILLIS
    # price: DOUBLE -> (inferred)
```

#### Bloom Filter Testing

Quickly test if values might exist in columns without reading the actual data:

```python
import rugo.parquet as parquet_meta

metadata = parquet_meta.read_metadata("example.parquet")

for col in metadata['row_groups'][0]['columns']:
    if parquet_meta.has_bloom_filter(col):
        # Test if a value might be present
        might_exist = parquet_meta.test_bloom_filter(
            "example.parquet",
            col['bloom_offset'],
            col['bloom_length'], 
            "search_value"
        )
        if might_exist:
            print(f"Value might be in column {col['name']}")
        else:
            print(f"Value definitely not in column {col['name']}")
```

#### Schema Conversion to Orso

Convert rugo parquet schemas to [orso](https://github.com/mabel-dev/orso) format:

```python
from rugo.converters.orso import rugo_to_orso_schema, extract_schema_only
import rugo.parquet as parquet_meta

# Read parquet metadata
metadata = parquet_meta.read_metadata("example.parquet")

# Convert to orso RelationSchema
orso_schema = rugo_to_orso_schema(metadata, "my_table")

print(f"Schema: {orso_schema.name}")
print(f"Columns: {len(orso_schema.columns)}")
print(f"Estimated rows: {orso_schema.row_count_estimate}")

# Access individual columns
for column in orso_schema.columns[:3]:
    print(f"{column.name}: {column.type} ({'nullable' if column.nullable else 'not null'})")

# Or get a simplified column mapping
schema_info = extract_schema_only(metadata, "simple_name")
print("Column types:", schema_info['columns'])
```

**Note:** Orso conversion requires the optional `orso` dependency:
```bash
pip install rugo[orso]

### Metadata Structure

The `read_metadata()` function returns a dictionary with the following structure:

```python
{
    "num_rows": int,           # Total number of rows in the file
    "row_groups": [            # List of row groups
        {
            "num_rows": int,           # Rows in this row group
            "total_byte_size": int,    # Size in bytes
            "columns": [               # Column metadata
                {
                    "name": str,           # Column name/path
                    "type": str,           # Physical type (INT64, BYTE_ARRAY, etc.)
                    "logical_type": str,   # Logical type (STRING, TIMESTAMP_MILLIS, etc.)
                    "min": any,            # Minimum value (decoded)
                    "max": any,            # Maximum value (decoded)
                    "null_count": int,     # Number of null values
                    "bloom_offset": int,   # Bloom filter offset (-1 if none)
                    "bloom_length": int,   # Bloom filter length (-1 if none)
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## ⚡ Performance

## 📊 What Rugo Does

**✅ Currently Supported:**
- **Fast Parquet metadata extraction** - Schema, statistics, row group information
- **Logical type detection** - STRING, TIMESTAMP, DECIMAL, etc.
- **Bloom filter testing** - Value presence checks without data scanning
- **Statistics decoding** - Min/max values properly typed and decoded
- **Cross-platform support** - Linux, macOS

**🎯 Focus Areas:**
Rugo is laser-focused on being the fastest Parquet metadata reader available. It doesn't try to be everything to everyone - it does one thing exceptionally well.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- **Metadata-only**: Rugo focuses on metadata extraction, not data reading
- **C++ compiler required**: Building from source requires C++17 compiler
- **Parquet-specific**: Designed specifically for Parquet format
