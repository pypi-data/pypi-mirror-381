Poottu (பூட்டு, pronounced Poo-ttu) means “lock” in Tamil, symbolizing security and protection. The name reflects the app’s purpose: a simple, safe, and trusted password manager.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- A virtual environment is recommended.

### Installation

1) Clone the repository and enter the project directory.

2) Create and activate a virtual environment:
- Windows:
  - python -m venv venv
  - venv\Scripts\activate
- macOS/Linux:
  - python3 -m venv venv
  - source venv/bin/activate

3) Install dependencies:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
  - or
- pip install "PySide6>=6.5.0" "argon2-cffi>=21.3.0" "pynacl>=1.5.0" "cryptography>=41.0.0" "platformdirs>=3.0.0" "zxcvbn>=4.5.0"


### Running

- From the project root:
  - python src/poottu/main.py

On first run without a vault, the Create window appears to set a master password. If a vault already exists, the Unlock window will prompt for the master password.

## Usage

### Create Master Password

- Enter and confirm a strong password.
- Requirements:
  - At least 12 characters.
  - Contains lowercase, uppercase, number, and special character.
- The strength checker will guide improvements if needed.
- Press Create to initialize the vault.

### Unlock Vault

- Enter master password and press Unlock or hit Enter.
- Use Show to verify the password if necessary.
- On error, an “Invalid master password” message appears.

### Main Window Overview

- Groups (left): pick a group to filter entries.
- Search (top): filters entries across Title, Username, URL, and Notes as text is typed.
- Entries (top-right): table with Title, Username, masked Password/Old Password, URL, Notes preview, and Expires.
- Preview (bottom-right): see details for the selected entry and reveal/hide password.

### File Menu

- Add Entry: create new credential records.
- Edit Groups: add, rename, and delete groups.
- Backup: export an encrypted backup file.
- Restore: import a previously exported encrypted backup.
- Clipboard → Configure Clear Timer…: choose the seconds before the clipboard is auto-cleared (0 disables).
- About: version, author, project URL, and full MIT license.
- Exit: close the app.

### Entries

- Add Entry: choose Group, then fill Title, Username, Password, Old Password, URL, Notes, optional Expires.
- Edit Entry: right-click rows or select a row and press F2.
- Delete Entry: right-click rows or press Delete, then confirm.

### Copying Safely

- Right-click an entry row to copy Username/Password/URL/Old Password/Notes.
- If the clipboard clear timer is enabled, copied data is automatically cleared after N seconds.
- A small HUD toast displays “Copied. Will clear in Ns” or “Copied.” when timer is disabled.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- Ctrl+N: Add Entry
- Ctrl+G: Edit Groups
- Ctrl+B: Backup
- Ctrl+R: Restore
- F2: Edit selected entry
- Delete: Delete selected entry

## Backup and Restore

- Backup creates an encrypted backup file; keep it in a safe location.
- Restore replaces current contents with the backup’s data after validation.
- Recommended:
  - Maintain multiple backups.
  - Verify backups periodically by restoring in a separate environment.

## Security Notes

- Offline-first: no automatic syncing or telemetry; everything stays local unless a manual backup is performed.
- Modern, authenticated encryption protects sensitive fields.
- Strong key derivation and header checks ensure data integrity and tamper resistance.
- Clipboard timer reduces the time secrets remain accessible to other apps.

## Best Practices

- Use unique, strong passwords for each account.
- Rotate passwords periodically; use the Expires field to track changes.
- Keep multiple encrypted backups in different secure locations.
- Never share the master password; it cannot be recovered if lost.
- Lock the OS session or close the app when stepping away from the computer.
- Keep the OS and Python environment up to date for security patches.

## Troubleshooting

- Invalid master password:
  - Check keyboard layout, caps lock, and try again.
- Clipboard not clearing:
  - Ensure the timer isn’t set to 0 (disabled) in File → Clipboard → Configure Clear Timer….
- Text readability:
  - The app uses accessible styles for light/dark themes. If a custom OS theme overrides defaults, consider adjusting system appearance for contrast.
