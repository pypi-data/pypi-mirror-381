Sometimes, when selling a product, it is necessary to require
documentation (authorization, ID, etc.) from the customer to justify the
sale. Examples: Sale of a corrosive product: A document authorizing its
handling is required. To control this process, we configure a Corrosive
category in the product listing.

Sale of alcohol: In this case, sales to minors are not permitted. To
control this process, we configure a Minor category in the product
listing.

This module allows you to control these processes through
identifications in the product listing.

Please note that this functionality depends on the
partner_identification module. For detailed setup and configuration,
please refer to that addon's documentation.

Usage
=====

Add identifications to the product
----------------------------------

1. Go to Sales -> Products -> Products

2. Create a new product

3. Go to the Sales tab and select the Required Identification option.

4. A tree will be enabled in which you must configure the required
   identification category (ies) for the product without repeating them.

   |ADD_IDENTIFICATION|

5. If you define any category as optional, a wizard will appear when
   confirming the order to confirm whether the identifications are
   correct and continue with the process.

6. Save

Validate order with identification products
-------------------------------------------

1. Go to Sales -> Orders -> Quotations

2. Create a new order and add any products that require identification
   to the lines.

3. Once the order is confirmed, the selected customer's ID numbers will
   be validated to see if they have the categories required for the
   added product(s).

4. If the partner does not have all the categories in their valid
   identification number (Validity Date), a message will be displayed
   with the missing categories (and their message defined in the
   product) to validate.

   |CATEGORY_REQUIRED|

5. When validating the required categories, the optional ones are
   validated, for which a wizard will be displayed to confirm.

   |CONFIRM_IDENTIFICATION|

6. If the customer has all the correct identifications, then the order
   confirmation follows its normal flow.
