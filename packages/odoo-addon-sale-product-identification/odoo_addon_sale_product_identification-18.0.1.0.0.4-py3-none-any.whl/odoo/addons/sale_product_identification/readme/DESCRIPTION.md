Sometimes, when selling a product, it is necessary to require documentation (authorization, ID, etc.) from the customer to justify the sale.
Examples:
Sale of a corrosive product: A document authorizing its handling is required. To control this process, we configure a Corrosive category in the product listing.

Sale of alcohol: In this case, sales to minors are not permitted. To control this process, we configure a Minor category in the product listing.

This module allows you to control these processes through identifications in the product listing.

Please note that this functionality depends on the partner_identification module. For detailed setup and configuration,
please refer to that addon's documentation.
