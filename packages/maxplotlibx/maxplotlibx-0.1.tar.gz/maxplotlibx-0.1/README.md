# maxplotlib

This is a wrapper for matplotlib so I can produce figures with consistent formatting. It also has some pretty nice additions such as using layers and exporting to tikz.

Related packages: [maxtikzlib](https://github.com/max-models/maxtikzlib) and [maxtexlib](https://github.com/max-models/maxtexlib).
