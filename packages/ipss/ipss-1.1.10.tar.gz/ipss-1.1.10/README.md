> "*Integrated path stability selection*" introduces IPSS and applies it to penalized parametric models such as lasso and adaptive lasso. "*Nonparametric IPSS: Fast, flexible feature selection with false discovery control*" extends IPSS to arbitrary feature importance scores, with a focus on scores from gradient boosting and random forests.

## Installation
```
pip install ipss
```

## Usage
```python
from ipss import ipss

# load n-by-p feature matrix X and n-by-1 response vector y

# run ipss
ipss_output = ipss(X,y)

# select features based on target FDR
target_fdr = 0.1
q_values = ipss_output['q_values']
selected_features = [idx for idx, q_value in q_values.items() if q_value <= target_fdr]
print(f'Selected features (target FDR = {target_fdr}): {selected_features}')
```
### Outputs
`ipss_output = ipss(X,y)` is a dictionary containing:
- `efp_scores`: Dictionary whose keys are feature indices and values are their efp scores (dict of length `p`).
- `q_values`: Dictionary whose keys are feature indices and values are their q-values (dict of length `p`).
- `runtime`: Runtime of the algorithm in seconds (float).
- `selected_features`: Indices of features selected by IPSS; empty list if `target_fp` and `target_fdr` are not specified (list of ints).
- `stability_paths`: Estimated selection probabilities at each parameter value (array of shape `(n_alphas, p)`)

### Selecting features
Each feature (column of `X`) is assigned:
- a **q-value**: the minimum false discovery rate (FDR) at which the feature is selected
- an **efp score**: the minimum expected number of false positives (E(FP)) at which the feature is selected

To select features:
- **Control FDR** by choosing all features with `q_value ≤ target_fdr`  
  _Example: Selecting features with `q_value ≤ 0.1` controls the FDR at level 0.1_
- **Control E(FP)** by choosing all features with `efp_score ≤ target_fp`  
  _Example: Selecting features with `efp_score ≤ 2` controls the E(FP) at level 2_

> In general, we recommend selecting features using `q_values` or `efp_scores` after running `ipss`, rather than specifying `target_fdr` or `target_fp` as arguments (see [General observations/recommendations](#general-observationsrecommendations)).

## Usage with custom feature importance scores
For custom feature importance scores, `selector` must be a function that takes `X` and `y` as inputs (as well as an optional
dictionary of arguments `selector_args` specific to the feature importance function), and returns a list or NumPy array of 
importance scores, one per feature, that must align with the column order in `X`.
```python
from ipss import ipss

# define custom feature importance function based on ridge regression
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
selector_args = {'alpha':1}
def ridge_selector(X, y, alpha):
	model = Ridge(alpha=alpha)
	model.fit(X,y)
	feature_importance_scores = np.abs(model.coef_)
	return feature_importance_scores

# load n-by-p feature matrix X and n-by-1 response vector y

# run ipss
ipss_output = ipss(X, y, selector=ridge_selector, selector_args=selector_args)

# select features based on target FDR
target_fdr = 0.1
q_values = ipss_output['q_values']
selected_features = [idx for idx, q_value in q_values.items() if q_value <= target_fdr]
print(f'Selected features (target FDR = {target_fdr}): {selected_features}')
```

## Full list of `ipss` arguments

### Required arguments:
- `X`: Features (array of shape `(n,p)`), where `n` is the number of samples and `p` is the number of features.
- `y`: Response (array of shape `(n,)` or `(n, 1)`). `ipss` automatically detects if `y` is binary.

### Optional arguments:
- `selector`: Base algorithm to use (str; default `'gb'`).
	- **Nonparametric methods**
		- `'gb'`: Gradient boosting (XGBoost).
		- `'rf'`: Random forest (scikit-learn).
	- **Penalized regression methods**
		- `'adaptive_lasso'`: Adaptive lasso (scikit-learn)
		- `'l1'`: L1-regularized linear or logistic regression (scikit-learn).
		<!-- - `'mcp'`: Minimax concave penalty (skglm). -->
		<!-- - `'scad'`: Smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty (skglm). -->
	- **Custom**
		- Users can provide their own feature importance function (see example above). 
- `selector_args`: Arguments for the base algorithm (dict; default `None`).
- `preselect`: Preselect/filter features prior to subsampling (bool; default `True`).
- `preselect_args`: Arguments for preselection algorithm (dict; default `None`).
- `target_fp`: Target number of false positives to control (positive float; default `None`).
- `target_fdr`: Target false discovery rate (FDR) (positive float; default `None`).
- `B`: Number of subsampling steps (int; default `100` if `selector` is `'gb'`, `50` otherwise).
- `n_alphas`: Number of values in the regularization or threshold grid (int; default `25` if `'l1'` else `100`).
- `ipss_function`: Function to apply to selection probabilities (str; default `'h2'` if `'l1'` else `'h3'`). Options:
	- `'h1'`: Linear function, ```h1(x) = 2x - 1 if x >= 0.5 else 0```.
	- `'h2'`: Quadratic function, ```h2(x) = (2x - 1)**2 if x >= 0.5 else 0```.
	- `'h3'`: Cubic function, ```h3(x) = (2x - 1)**3 if x >= 0.5 else 0```.
- `cutoff`: Maximum value of the theoretical integral bound `I(Lambda)` (positive float; default `0.05`).
- `delta`: Defines probability measure; see `Associated papers` (float; defaults depend on `selector`).
- `standardize_X`: Scale features to have mean 0, standard deviation 1 (bool; default `None`).
- `center_y`: Center response to have mean 0 (bool; default `None`).
- `n_jobs`: Number of jobs to run in parallel (int; default `1`).

### General observations/recommendations:
- `selector = 'gb'` often best for capturing nonlinear relationships
- `selector = 'l1'` or `'adaptive_lasso'` often best for capturing linear relationships
- For FDR control, we generally recommend computing q-values with `ipss` and then using them to select features at the desired FDR threshold (as in the [Usage](#usage) section above), rather than specifying `target_fdr`, which should be left as `None`. This provides greater flexibility when selecting features.
- For E(FP) control, we generally recommend computing efp scores with `ipss` and then using them to select features at the desired false positive threshold, rather than specifying `target_fp`, which should be left as `None`. This provides greater flexibility when selecting features.
- In general, all other parameters should not be changed
	- `selector_args` include, e.g., decision tree parameters for tree-based models
	- Results are robust to `B` provided it is greater than `25`
	- `'h3'` is less conservative than `'h2'` which is less conservative than `'h1'`.
	- Preselection can significantly reduce computation time.
	- Results are robust to `cutoff` provided it is between `0.025` and `0.1`.
	- Results are robust to `delta` provided it is between `0` and `1.5`.
	- Features are automatically standardized for the penalized regression methods.
	- The response is automatically centered for the penalized regression methods.
