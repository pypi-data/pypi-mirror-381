# PyLevel Optimisation (PyLOpt)

PyLOpt is a PyTorch-based library for learning hyperparameters $\theta$ within the context of image reconstruction by means of solving the bilevel problem

$$(P_\text{bilevel}) ~~~~~\inf_{\theta} F(u_{\theta}, u^{(0)}) ~~~ \text{s.t.}  
    ~~~ u_{\theta}\in\mathop{\text{arginf}}_{u}E(u, u^{(\delta)}, \theta)$$

The function $F$ refers to the upper loss function quantifying the goodness of the learned $\theta$ w.r.t. groundtruth data $u^{(0)}$. $E$ denotes the lower cost or energy function, which is used to reconstruct clean data $u^{(0)}$ from noisy observations $u^{(\delta)}$. We assume that $E$ is of the form

$$E(u, u^{(\delta)}, \theta) = 
    \frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}\|u - u^{(\delta)}\|_{2}^{2} + \lambda R(u, \theta)$$

where $\sigma$ indicates the noise level, $R$ refers to a regulariser and $\lambda>0$ denotes a regularisation parameter. We consider trainable regulariser modelled by means of a Fields of Experts (FoE) model: Let $k_{1}, \ldots, k_{m}$ denote quadratic image filters and let $\rho(\cdot| \gamma)$ be a parameter-dependent potential function. For the potential parameters $\gamma_{1}, \ldots, \gamma_{m}$, and the merged parameter $\theta$ comprising filters and potential parameters, we define

$$R(u, \theta) = \sum_{j}\sum_{i}\rho([k_{j} * u]_{i}|\gamma_{j}),$$

where in the inner sum we sum up all elements of the $j$-th filter response.

#### Objective

PyLOpt aims to serve as a toolbox for scientists and engineers to address bilevel problems in imaging supporting different gradient-based solution methods. The package is modular and extendable by design and follows familiar interfaces from pupular Python packages such as SciPy ([[2]](#2)), scikit-learn ([[8]](#8)) and PyTorch ([[9]](#9)).

## Features

### Current features

- Image reconstruction using pretrained filter and potential models by solving the lower level problem $\mathop{\text{arginf}}_{u}E(u, u^{(\delta)}, \theta)$ using one of the following gradient-based methods
  - NAG: Nesterov accelerated gradient method - see f.e. [[5]](#5)
  - NAPG: Proximal gradient method with Nesterov acceleration - see f.e. [[4]](#4)
  - Adam: See [[6]](#6)
  - Unrolling: Both NAG and NAPG are implemented as well using an unrolled approach. This allows to solve the upper-level problem using automatic differentiation.
- Training of filters and/or potentials of an FoE regualriser model by solving the bilevel problem $P_\text{bilevel}$. The training relies on the application of one the following gradient-based methods onto the upper problem:
  - NAG
  - Adam
  - LBFGS: Quasi-Newton method - see [[7]](#7)

  Gradients of solutions of the lower level problem w.r.t. the parameter $\theta$ are computed or by implicit differentiation, or automatic differentiation provided the lower problem is solved by means of an unrolling scheme. 
- Modularity and extensibility: The package is modular by design. Its architecture allows easy customization and extension. Each of the core components
  - ImageFilter
  - Potential
  - FieldsOfExperts
  - Energy

  is encapsulated in its own module. Thus, all of these components can be exchanged easily without any need to modify the core logic. In addition, methods for the solution of the lower problem (`solve_lower.py`) and the upper problem (`solve_bilevel.py`) can easily be added.
- The repository contains pretrained models and sample scripts and notebooks showing the application of the package for image denoising.

### Upcoming features

- Sampling based approach for solving inner problem

## Installation

Recommended Python version: >= 3.11

### Installation via pip

1. Install all the dependencies first using the requirements file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that not all the packages listed in `requirements.txt` are strictly required to use the package. For usage
of the package only, the dependencies related to the `build-process` and the `publishing-process` can be omitted.

2. Finally, install `PyLOpt` via
```
pip install pylopt
```

#### Note

The pip package contains only the CPU supported version of the extension package `quartic_bspline_extension`. To use it
with CUDA support, it needs to be built locally:
  1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/VLOGroup/quartic_bspline_extension
  2. In the root directory of the repository run `make build`.
  3. The builds (CPU & CUDA if NVIDIA-capable GPU is detected, CPU only else) are stored in the artefacts subdirectory.
  4. Install the package using the generated Python wheel by `pip install *artefacts/<package_name>.whl`

### Installation from source

```
git clone https://github.com/VLOGroup/pylopt.git
```

## Core components 

The FoE regulariser is implemented via the `FieldsOfExperts` class. It combines an `ImageFilter`, which defines the convolutional filters applied to the image, and a subclass of `Potential`, which models the corresponding potential functions. The lower problem is modelled by the PyTorch module `Energy`, which represents the energy function to be minimised. An object of this class contains an `MÌ€easurementModel` instance, a PyTorch module modeling the measurement process, and a `FieldsOfExperts` instance as its components. 

Image reconstruction or the solution of the lower level problem is carried out by the function `solve_lower()`. The training of filters and potentials is managed by the class `BilevelOptimisation`. 

For the usage of the package and its methods see section [Usage](#usage).

## Usage

### Conceptual

The interface of the function `solve_lower()` which is used to solve the lower level problem is designed to closely follow the conventions of SciPy optimisation routines. Given an `Energy` instance, the corresponding lower level problem can be solved for example using Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (NAG) via

```python
lower_prob_result = solve_lower(energy=energy, method='nag', 
                                options={'max_num_iterations': 1000, 'rel_tol': 1e-5, 'batch_optimisation': False})
```

The upper-level optimisation, i.e. training of filters and potential parameters, follows conventions of scikit-learn for interface design and usability. Training these parameters using Adam for the upper level optimisation and NAPG for the lower level optimisation is obtained via

```python

prox = DenoisingProx(noise_level=noise_level)
bilevel_optimisation = BilevelOptimisation(method_lower='napg',
                                           options_lower={'max_num_iterations': 1000, 'rel_tol': 1e-5, 'prox': prox, 
                                                          'batch_optimisation': False}, 
                                           operator=torch.nn.Identity(),
                                           noise_level=0.1, 
                                           solver='cg', options_solver={'max_num_iterations': 500},
                                           path_to_experiments_dir=path_to_eval_dir)

bilevel_optimisation.learn(regulariser, lam, l2_loss_func, train_image_dataset,
                           optimisation_method_upper='adam', 
                           optimisation_options_upper={'max_num_iterations': 10000, 'lr': [1e-3, 1e-1], 
                                                       'alternating': True},
                           dtype=dtype, device=device, callbacks=callbacks, schedulers=schedulers)

```

### Concrete

Concrete and executable code for training and prediction is contained in `pylopt/examples`. Please note that reproducibility of training results can be obtained only when using the datatype `torch.float64`. However, this comes at the cost of increased computation time. 

#### Denoising using pretrained models

- **Example I**
  - Filters: Pretrained filters from [[1]](#1)
  - Potential: 
    - Type: Student-t
    - Weights: Optimised using `pylopt`

  To run the script, execute

    ```
    python examples/scripts/denoising_predict.py
    ```
  
  Alternatively, run the Jupyter notebook `denoising_predict.ipynb`. Denoising the images `watercastle` and `koala` of the well known BSDS300 dataset (see [[3]](#3)), we obtain

  | Method  | Options                                                                                                         | mean PSNR [dB] | Iter | Time [s] on GPU |
  |:-------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------:|:----:|:---------------:|
  |  'nag'  | ``` {'max_num_iterations': 1000, 'rel_tol': 1e-5, 'batch_optimisation': False, 'lip_const': 1e1} ```            | 29.199         | 312  | 0.988           |
  | 'napg'  | ``` {'max_num_iterations': 1000, 'rel_tol': 1e-5, 'prox': ..., 'batch_optimisation': False, 'lip_const': 1} ``` | 29.207         | 361  | 1.577           |
  | 'adam'  | ``` {'max_num_iterations': 1000, 'rel_tol': 1e-5, 'lr': [1e-3, 1e-3], 'batch_optimisation': False} ```          | 28.833         | 1000 | 1.667           |

  and, when using the NAG optimiser:

#### Training of FoE models

The script `denoising_train.py` contains several setups for training filters and/or potential functions. To run the script with the corresponding
setup, ececute 

```
python examples/scripts/denoising_train.py --example <example_id>
```

with example_id in {training_I, training_II, training_III}. In the following an overview of these examples is presented.

- **Example I** (example_id = training_I)
  - Filters: 
    - Pretrained filters from [[1]](#1)
    - Frozen, e.g. non-trainable
  - Potential: 
    - Type: Student-t
    - Weights:
      - Uniform initialisation
      - Trainable 
  - Lower level: NAPG
  - Upper level NAG with Lipschitz-constant scheduling

  By employing the NAG optimizer together with NAGLipConstGuard() to solve the upper-level problem, reasonable potentials 
  can be learned after only a few iterations. Using the Berkeley dataset (BSD300) for training and the images `watercastle` 
  and `koala` for validation during training, one obtains the following training stats:

  ![](data/images/results/training_I/training_stats.png)

- **Example II** (example_id = training_II)
  - Filters:
    - Size: 7x7
    - Random initialisation
    - Trainable
  - Potential:
    - Type: Student-t
    - Weights: 
      - Uniform initialisation
      - Trainable
  - Optimiser:
    - Inner: NAPG
    - Outer: Adam with cosine-annealed learning rate scheduling

  After 10,000 iterations, the resulting learned filters and potential functions are as follows:

  ![](data/images/results/training_II/filters_and_potentials_48.png)

- **Example III** ((example_id = training_III))

  - Filters:
    - Size: 7x7
    - Random initialisation
    - Trainable
  - Potential:
    - Type: Spline
    - Weights: 
      - 
      - Trainable
  - Optimiser:
    - Inner: NAPG
    - Outer:
