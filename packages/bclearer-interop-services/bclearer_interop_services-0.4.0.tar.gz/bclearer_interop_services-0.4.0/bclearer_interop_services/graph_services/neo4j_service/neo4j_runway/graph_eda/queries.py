"""
The GraphEDA Queries module contains queries that return
information about the Neo4j database and its contents.

The purpose of GraphEDA is to understand the characteristics
of the data in graph form (nodes, relationships, and properties).
This also helps identify errors and outliers in the data.

The methods in this class primarily use Cypher to query and analyze
data in the graph. The queries use Cypher because apoc.meta.schema
uses sampling techniques and so the results are not necessarily deterministic.

WARNING: The functions in this module can be computationally expensive.
It is not recommended to use this module on massive Neo4j databases
(i.e., nodes and relationships in the hundreds of millions)
