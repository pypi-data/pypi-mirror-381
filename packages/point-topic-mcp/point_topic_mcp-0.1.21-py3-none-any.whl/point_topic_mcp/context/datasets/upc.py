DB_INFO = """

Broadband availability datasets for the UK at postcode granularity. Monthly snapshots.

UPC stands for unit post code, so all UPC tables are at postcode granularity

The reported_at field always lands on the first day of the month.

Remember that footprint/premises passed is not the same as market share. 
The market share would be the number of subscribers (paying customers), 
wheras the footprint is the number of premises that have availability

Key UK Broadband Market Facts (for sanity checking):
- Total UK premises: approximately 33 million
- Total UK households: approximately 30 million  
- Total UK population: approximately 67 million
- If your query results show significantly different totals, double-check your calculations

Always sanity check your results against these known facts.

CRITICAL: Market Share and Total Premises Calculations

upc_core.reports.fact_operator is unique per postcode,operator,tech and reported_at
so when getting sums of premises by joining upc on postcode,reported_at you must
get the distinct list of postcodes, as there can be duplicates when an operator has multiple technology

MARKET SHARE CALCULATIONS:
- For calculating TOTAL UK premises or market denominators, ALWAYS use upc_core.reports.upc_output directly
- Careful when summing premises from upc_core.reports.fact_operator joins as this can creates duplicates for shared postcodes
- Individual operator footprints: Use distinct postcodes from upc_core.reports.fact_operator joined to upc_output
- Total market size: Use SUM(premises) FROM upc_core.reports.upc_output directly

Make a note that this is AVAILABILITY market share, not based on Subscribers

Example pattern for market share:
1. Operator footprint: select sum(premises) from upc_core.reports.fact_operator f join upc_core.reports.upc_output u USING(postcode) WHERE f.operator = 'X' GROUP BY postcode
2. Total market: select sum(premises) from upc_core.reports.upc_output (separate query, not derived from operator data)

Note the virgin media isps are as follows:
'Virgin Media RFOG'
'Virgin Cable'

For altnet queries we exclude Openreach ops and virgin media ops 

for example:
where operator not in ('BT','Sky','TalkTalk','Vodafone','Virgin Cable','Virgin Media RFOG')

we also group together the CityFibre ops:
when operator like '%CityFibre%' then 'CityFibre'

To see the full list of operators available in the database, use the get_distinct_value_list('upc','operator') tool.

Tips for UPC tables:
1. For fttp queries to fact_operator, you can use the tech like '%fttp%' filter because there is one type of value 'fttponly'
2. If the answer only requires current data then use the upc_output or fact_operator tables directly. No need to use the time series tables.
3. CRITICAL FOR MARKET SHARE AND AVAILABILITY SUMS: Total UK premises must come from upc_output directly. Never derive totals from fact_operator joins.
4. If the question is about how many homes were passed by an operator - Then use the households metric in the upc output table.
