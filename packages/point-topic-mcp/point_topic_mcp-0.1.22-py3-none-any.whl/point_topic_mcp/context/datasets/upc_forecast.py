This database contains data for forecasting broadband infrastructure deployment in the UK. It includes a table with postcode-level attractiveness scores and another with semi-annual footprint forecasts for key operators.

--- TABLE: all_general_attractiveness ---

This table provides a quarterly time-series of "attractiveness scores" for every UK postcode, indicating its potential for new broadband infrastructure investment.

Key Points:
- Granularity: Data is available for the full set of ~1.7 million UK postcodes for each quarter, starting from '2021Q2'.
- Time Columns:
  - `quarter`: The primary time dimension, formatted as 'YYYYQ[1-4]' (e.g., '2023Q4').
  - `reported_at`: A date representation of the quarter, always the first day of the last month of that quarter (e.g., '2023Q4' corresponds to '2023-12-01').
- Attractiveness Score:
  - The `general_attractiveness` column is the primary score.
  - CRITICAL: This score is a direct sum of the other factor columns (`time_since_last_upgrade`, `affordability`, `population_density`, `broadband_infrastructure`, `digital_deprivation`).
  - All factor columns are scaled from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates a more positive contribution to the attractiveness score.

--- TABLE: int_forecast_output ---

This table contains semi-annual forecasts of network footprint for specific UK broadband operators up to the end of 2030.

Key Points:
- Granularity: The table contains a forecast for every UK postcode for each operator at each forecast period.
- Footprint Logic: The `present` column is a binary flag (1 for present, 0 for not present). It indicates if an operator is predicted to have a presence in that postcode by the end of the forecast period.
- Cumulative Growth: The footprint is cumulative. If an operator has `present` = 1 for a given postcode and `reported_at`, they will also have `present` = 1 for all subsequent `reported_at` dates. The network footprint only grows or stays the same.
- The data start from 2025

CRITICAL: Understanding the `reported_at` column in `int_forecast_output` is essential to avoid mistakes. It does NOT represent when the forecast was made, but rather the point in time the forecast is FOR.

- `yyyy-06-01`: Represents the forecast for the state of the network at the **END of year yyyy**.
- `yyyy-12-01`: Represents the forecast for the state of the network at the **END of the first half of year yyyy+1**.

Query Examples for `int_forecast_output`:
- To find an operator's footprint at the end of 2025: `WHERE reported_at = '2025-06-01'`
- To find an operator's footprint at the mid-point of 2026 (end of H1 2026): `WHERE reported_at = '2025-12-01'`
- To find the footprint at the end of 2030: `WHERE reported_at = '2030-06-01'` (this is the latest date in the table).

--- General Tips & Common Queries ---

1.  **Joining Tables**: The most common use case is to join these tables on `postcode`. Be mindful of the time columns. For example, you might want to join `all_general_attractiveness` from '2023Q4' (`reported_at` = '2023-12-01') with the `int_forecast_output` for the end of 2024 (`reported_at` = '2024-06-01') to see if high-attractiveness areas are being targeted for future builds.

2.  **Calculating New Build**: To find the postcodes where an operator is forecast to build in a specific period (e.g., the second half of 2027), you need to subtract the footprint of the previous period.
    - Example for H2 2027 build:
      1. Get postcodes where `present` = 1 for `reported_at` = '2027-06-01' (End of 2027).
      2. Get postcodes where `present` = 1 for `reported_at` = '2026-12-01' (Mid-2027).
      3. The difference between set (1) and set (2) represents the build during H2 2027. This can be done with a `LEFT JOIN` and checking for `NULL` or using `EXCEPT`.

3.  **Available Operators**: The operators available in the `int_forecast_output` table are:
