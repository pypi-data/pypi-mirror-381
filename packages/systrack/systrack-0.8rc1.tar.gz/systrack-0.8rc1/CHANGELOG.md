Systrack changelog
==================


v0.7
----

New arch support: RISC-V 32-bit and 64-bit, tested on v4.15+ kernels (i.e.,
since the first Linux version supporting RISC-V).

**Improvements**:

- Improve dummy syscall implementation detection: try to first match known
  "ni_syscall" code.
- Improve error messages and debug/info logs, pretty printing command-line
  arguments and executed commands instead of dumping their tuple/list
  representation.
- mips: implement simple arch-specific dummy syscall detection.
- arm64: remove "arm64_" arch-specific prefix from syscall names.

**Bug fixes**:

- mips: new dummy syscall detection now correctly identifies some dummy syscalls
  that were previously missed (notably `cachestat`).

**Internal changes**:

- Archs can now specify multiple kernel Makefile config targets to run one after
  the other as a "base" config.


v0.6
----

**Improvements**:

- More robust and comprehensive syscall definition location search.

**Bug fixes**:

- Fix broken syscall definition location search and subsequent signature
  extraction. Some syscalls were incorrectly reported as defined in place of
  others, also causing the wrong signature to be extracted. Do not fully trust
  the output of `addr2line` and perform full syscall name matching to fix this.
  PowerPC was notably affected the most by this issue.


v0.5.1
------

**Improvements**:

- x86: improve x86 syscall extraction code fixing undetected CALL targets.

**Internal changes**:

- x86: add some tests for syscall extraction based on v6.11 kernel build.


v0.5
----

We tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end, we need a disassembler! x86
mitigations have defeated us, we no longer have syscall tables to rely on.
Kernel developers were kind enough to write very simple ABI-specific
switch-based handlers to dispach syscalls, so analysis is still possible... just
significantly more complicated.

**Breaking changes**:

- Drop support for Python 3.6 and 3.7. Systrack now requires Python 3.8+. This
  is because of the new dependency on
  [`iced-x86`](https://pypi.org/project/iced-x86/).

**Improvements**:

- x86: support new kernels (6.9+) with no syscall tables.
- Remove unnecessary spaces between asterisks for double pointers in function
  signatures.
- Avoid KFCI `__{cfi,pfx}_` symbols when looking for `ni_syscall` symbols.

**Internal changes**:

- Depend on [`iced-x86`](https://pypi.org/project/iced-x86/) for disassembling
  x86 instructions and on [`jinja2`](https://pypi.org/project/jinja2/) for HTML
  output directly. Remove optional dependencies and only build one package.
- Rename `test` folder to `tests` to use the `hatch test` as test commnad
- Improve logging reproducibility by sorting more debugging log output.
- Improve broken Python package metadata (Python packaging moment).


v0.4
----

New arch support: PowerPC 32-bit, tested on v5.0+ kernels.

**Improvements**:

- Improve kconfig dependency checking logic for better warning/error messages.
- PowerPC PPC64: improve esoteric fast switch_endian syscall detection.
- Better (narrower) emoji spacing in HTML output.

**Bug fixes**:

- Correctly report `delete_module` depending on `CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD=y`.
- Fix incorrectly handled shared syscall table in x86-64 x32 ABI resulting in
  duplicated and unwanted entries in the output for kernels older than v5.4.
- Fix chance of building kernels without `memfd_create`, `memfd_secret`,
  `delete_module` (and possibly others) by always enabling `MEMFD_CREATE`,
  `MODULE_UNLOAD`, `NET` and `SECRETMEM` when available.
- Fix wrong handling of relative `--kdir` path (e.g., `.`) in some cases.
- Fix missed detection of non-implemented syscalls pointing to `kernel/sys_ni.c`
  when DWARF debug info contains relative paths.
- x86 x32: fix some x64 syscalls reported twice because both the x64 number and
  the historycally misnumbered x32 numbers (512-547) were being considered
  valid.

**Internal changes**:

- Ignore `sound/` and `user/` dirs to speed up grepping syscall definitions.
- Implement some basic unit tests for powerpc dummy/esoteric syscall detection.


v0.3.3
------

**Improvements**:

- Correctly report `lsm_{list_modules,get_self_attr,set_self_attr}` depending on
  `CONFIG_SECURITY=y`.


v0.3.2
------

**Improvements**:

- Correctly report `futex_{wait,wake,requeue}` depending on `CONFIG_FUTEX=y`.
- Use unicorn emoji (cuter) instead of test tube for esoteric syscalls in HTML
  output.


v0.3.1
------

**Improvements**:

- x86: Add build support for `map_shadow_stack`.
- Prefer `compat_sys_` over `__se_compat_sys_` and other longer symbol synonyms;
  same for `.compat_sys_` on PowerPC.

**Bug fixes**:

- Fix broken naive grepping of syscall definitions when no ripgrep is available.
- Correctly report `cachestat` depending on `CACHESTAT_SYSCALL=y`.

**Internal changes**:

- Sort stderr logs for reproducible output and easier diffing.
- Skip `lib/` directory in kernel sources to improve grepping performance.


v0.3
----

New arch support: PowerPC 64-bit, all ABIs, tested on v5.0+ kernels.

**Improvements:**

- Add ABI `bits` (integer) and `compat` (boolean) fields to JSON output.
- Support ELF symbols with weird names (special chars in the name).
- Support function descriptors for syscall table entries (useful for PowerPC64
  and Itanium 64).
- Support weird arch-specific `SYSCALL_DEFINEn` macros.
- Building kernels now generates relative paths in DWARF debug symbols through
  `-fdebug-prefix-map`.
- Improve stdout output and add a table header.
- Use `null` instead of `??`/`?` for unknown file/line info in JSON output.
- x86: improve dummy syscall implementation detection (handling endbr64/32
  instructions).
- ARM OABI: output syscall number location for the calling convention
  (`swi <NR>`).

**Bug fixes**:

- Correctly report `socketcall` depending on `CONFIG_NET=y`.
- Correctly strip more syscall symbol prefixes for more accurate syscall names.
- Fix bad symbol prefix detection in some weird edge cases, leading to wrong
  syscall names.
- x86: fix wrong register names for x86-64 compat 32-bit ABI (IA-32).

**Internal changes**:

- Reorganize arch-specific code.
- Handle SIGINT for more graceful termination.
- Auto-remap definition locations relative to KDIR for ease of use.


v0.2.1
------

**Improvements**:

- Make syscall symbol preference more consistent (in particular, stop mixing
  `__se_sys_xxx` and `sys_xxx` when possible).
- Achieve W3C compliance for HTML output format.

**Bug fixes**:

- x86: correct wrong syscall numbers for x32 ABI, they should all be ORed with
  `0x40000000` (`__X32_SYSCALL_BIT`).


v0.2
----

**Improvements**:

- Improve existing MIPS build and analysis support: use `ip27_defconfig` for
  64-bit for NUMA support and strip more symbol prefixes.
- Improve dummy syscall implementation detection (x86-64, ARM).

**Bug fixes**:

- Fix help text for `--arch`: building with `--arch arm` creates an
  EABI-only kernel.
- Fix a logging bug that caused not loging syscalls' `.origname` for not-found
  locations after grepping.
- x86: use the right Kconfig option for vm86 and vm86old


v0.1
----

First release.
