## Installation

```pip install fastmath```

## Usage

You should import module that you need to use from fastmath

For example you need to use sinus function. You should situate 

```from mathhunt import functions

print(functions.sinus(45, "deg"))```

Here you can see 2 arguments

##Volume-calculation

- The volume function calculates the volume of various 3D shapes  based on the provided shape type and corresponding metrics. It supports multiple geometric shapes and ensures input validation for accurate calculations.

**Parameters**
```*args (float)```: A variable-length argument list representing the necessary metrics for the specified shape (e.g., radius, height, side length). The number of arguments required depends on the shape type.

```type (str)```: A string that specifies the type of shape for which the volume is to be calculated. Supported types include:

'parallelepiped'
'cube'
'cylinder'
'sphere'
'cone'
'pyramid'
'tetrahedron'
'octahedron'
'icosahedron'
Returns
float: The calculated volume of the specified shape.
Raises
TypeError:

If any of the input metrics (*args) are not numbers (either int or float).
If the type parameter is not a string.
ValueError:

If the specified shape type is invalid (not one of the supported types).
If the number of arguments does not match the expected count for the specified shape type.
If any of the provided metrics are non-positive (less than or equal to zero).

**Examples of usage**

> Calculate the volume of a cube with side length 3
volume_cube = volume(3, type='cube')  # Returns: 27.0

> Calculate the volume of a cylinder with radius 2 and height 5
volume_cylinder = volume(2, 5, type='cylinder')  # Returns: 25.12

> Calculate the volume of a sphere with radius 4
volume_sphere = volume(4, type='sphere')  # Returns: 268.08

> Invalid usage example
```volume_invalid = volume(2, 3, type='invalid_shape')```
Raises ValueError

##Area-calculation
- The square function calculates the area of various 2D shapes based on the specified shape type and corresponding metrics. This function is designed to handle multiple geometric shapes and includes robust input validation for accurate area calculations.

**Parameters**
```*args (float):``` A variable-length argument list that represents the necessary metrics for the specified shape (e.g., side lengths, radius). The number of arguments required varies depending on the shape type.

```type (str):``` A string that specifies the type of shape for which the area is to be calculated. Supported types include:

'quadrate'
'rectangle'
'triangle_h' (triangle with base and height)
'triangle_s' (triangle with three sides)
'circle'
'trapezoid'
'rhombus'
'parallelogram'
'sector'
'ellipse'
'polygon'
'sphere' (note: typically, spheres are 3D; area may refer to the surface area calculation)
Returns
float: The function returns the calculated area of the specified shape.
Raises
TypeError:

If any of the input metrics (*args) are not numeric (i.e., not of type int or float).
If the type parameter is not a string.
ValueError:

If the specified shape type is invalid (not one of the recognized types).
If the number of provided arguments does not match the expected count for the specified shape type.
If any of the provided metrics are non-positive (i.e., less than or equal to zero).

**Example of usage**

> Calculate the area of a square with side length 4
area_square = square(4, type='quadrate')  # Expected output: 16.0

> Calculate the area of a rectangle with width 3 and height 5
area_rectangle = square(3, 5, type='rectangle')  # Expected output: 15.0

> Calculate the area of a triangle with base 4 and height 3
area_triangle_h = square(4, 3, type='triangle_h')  # Expected output: 6.0

> Calculate the area of a circle with radius 2
area_circle = square(2, type='circle')  # Expected output: 12.56

> Invalid usage example
area_invalid = square(3, type='invalid_shape')  
This will raise ValueError
