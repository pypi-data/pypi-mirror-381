# Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate.
# Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old,
# and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth's fields, and where They
# still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread.
