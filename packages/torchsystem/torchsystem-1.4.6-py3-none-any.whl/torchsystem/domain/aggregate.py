    An AGGREGATE is a cluster of associated objects that we treat as a unit for the purpose
    of data changes. Each AGGREGATE has a root and a boundary. The boundary defines what is
    inside the AGGREGATE. The root is a single, specific ENTITY contained in the AGGREGATE and
    provides the IDENTITY of the AGGREGATE. The root is the only member of the AGGREGATE that
    outside objects are allowed to hold references to.

    In deep learning, an AGGREGATE consist not only of a neural network, but also several other
    components such as optimizers, schedulers, tokenizers, etc.  For example, a transformer model
    is just a neural network, and in order to perform tasks such as text completion or translation,
    it needs to be part of an AGGREGATE that includes other components like a tokenizer. The AGGREGATE
    is responsible for coordinating the interactions between these components.

    Attributes:
        id (Any): The id of the AGGREGATE ROOT. It should be unique within the AGGREGATE boundary.
        phase (str): The phase of the AGGREGATE.
        events (Events): The domain events of the AGGREGATE.

    Methods:
        onphase:
            A hook that is called when the phase changes. Implement this method to add custom behavior.

        onepoch:
            A hook that is called when the epoch changes. Implement this method to add custom behavior.

    Example:
        ```python
