    A DOMAIN EVENT is a representation of something that has happened in the DOMAIN.

class Events:
    """
    A collection of DOMAIN EVENTS that have occurred within a Bounded context. The EVENTS
    class is responsible for managing the events that have occurred within the Bounded context
    and dispatching them to the appropriate handlers.

    When an event is enqueued, it is added to the queue of events to be processed. When the `commit`
    method is called, the events are dequeued and dispatched to the appropriate handlers. If no handler
    is found for an event, the event is ignored, except if the event is an exception.

    Exceptions are treated as domain events but they are raised when the `commit` method is called by
    default if no handler is found for it's type.

    Attributes:
        queue (deque[Event]): A queue of DOMAIN EVENTS that have occurred within the Bounded context.
        handlers (dict[type[Event], Sequence[Callable]]): A dictionary of handlers that are responsible for handling
            DOMAIN EVENTS. The key is the type of the event and the value is the handler function.

    Example:
        ```python
        from torchsystem.domain import Events, Event

        class ClsEvent(Event):...

        class ObjEvent(Event):
            def __init__(self, value):
                self.value = value

        class OtherObjEvent(Event):
            def __init__(self, willbeignored):
                self.value = willbeignored

        events = Events()
        events.enqueue(ClsEvent)
        events.enqueue(KeyError) # Enqueues a KeyError exception event
        events.enqueue(ObjEvent('somevalue'))
        events.enqueue(OtherObjEvent('willbeignored'))
        events.enqueue(StopIteration) # Enqueues a StopIteration exception event

        events.handlers[ClsEvent] = lambda: print('ClsEvent was handled.')
        events.handlers[KeyError] = lambda: print('KeyError was handled.')
        events.handlers[ObjEvent] = lambda event: print(f'ObjEvent was handled with value: {event.value}')
        events.handlers[OtherObjEvent] = lambda: print('OtherObjEvent was handled.')

        try:
            events.commit()
        except StopIteration:
            print('StopIteration exception was raised.')

        # Output:
        #ClsEvent was handled.
        #KeyError was handled.
        #ObjEvent was handled with value: somevalue
        #OtherObjEvent was handled.
        #StopIteration exception was raised. Usefull for early stopping in training loops.
