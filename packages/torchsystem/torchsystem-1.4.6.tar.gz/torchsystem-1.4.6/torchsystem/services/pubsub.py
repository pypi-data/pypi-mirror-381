    A SUBSCRIBER is a component that listens for messages published processes them accordingly.

    Unlike a CONSUMER, a SUBSCRIBER receives messages only from the topics it has subscribed to
    and it's the PUBLISHER's responsibility to route the messages accordingly.

    Methods:
        register:
            Registers a message type and its corresponding handler function.

        subscribe:
            Decorator for registering a handler function to one or more topics.

        receive:
            Receives a message from a given topic and triggers the corresponding handler functions
            to process it.

    Example:
        ```python	
        from torchsystem import Depends
        from torchsystem.services import Subscriber
        from torchsystem.services import Publisher

        subscriber = Subscriber()
        metricsdb = []
