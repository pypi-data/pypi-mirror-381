<h2>Thermal String Fragmentation</h2> 
 
The thermal model <ref>Fis16</ref> is an attempt to combine global 
flavour and <ei>pT</ei> concepts familiar from the heavy-ion 
community with the local conservation rules obtained in a string 
framework. To replace the standard Lund fragmentation model with 
the thermal one you need to set <code> Fragmentation:model = 1</code> 
in your main program. 
 
<p/> 
One can give at least three arguments why it is not a 
completely crazy variation of the standard Lund fragmentation 
setup. Firstly, low-energy low-<ei>pT</ei> data for many 
hadron species are empirically well described by <ei>pT</ei> 
spectra of the shape <ei>exp(-6 mT)</ei>, where <ei>mT</ei> 
is the hadron transverse mass. Secondly, Hagedorn's 
thermodynamical arguments suggest that indeed hadron <ei>pT</ei> 
spectra should be of the shape <ei>exp(-mT / T)</ei>, 
where <ei>T</ei> is the temperature of the particle-producing 
source. Thirdly, one could imagine that a string is fluctuating 
along its length, where a contraction leads to an increased string 
tension, and vice versa. Bialas showed that a reasonable ansatz 
for such fluctuations can turn a Gaussian <ei>pT</ei> distribution 
into an exponential one. 
 
<p/> 
The current framework keeps most of the string fragmentation code 
unchanged. The big differences are that the new derived classes 
<code>ThermalStringFlav</code> and <code>ThermalStringpT</code> 
take care of flavour and pT selection, with free parameters as 
described below. The longitudinal selection in <code>StringZ</code> 
remains unchanged, so the settings on the 
<aloc href="ZSelection">z Selection</aloc> page can be used also 
here. 
 
<p/> 
In the thermal fragmentation, as implemented here, the <ei>pT</ei> 
selection has to be done before the flavour one, which is opposite 
to the order in normal string fragmentation. (Although of less 
relevance there.) To cover both possibilities, the 
<code>StringFragmentation</code> class has a method 
<code>setFlavBeforePT</code> to fix the order. In either option the 
<ei>z</ei> selection occurs last.

<h3>Transverse momentum selection</h3> 
 
The quark <ei>pT</ei> is generated according to a complicated 
expression (involving the Bessel <ei>K_{1/4}</ei> function), 
such that the resulting hadron <ei>pT</ei> follows a thermal 
distribution 
<eq> 
    d(Prob) = exp( -pT_had/T) d^2pT_had 
</eq> 
with temperature <ei>T</ei>, whose value is given by 
<parm name="StringPT:temperature" default="0.21" min="0.1" max="0.5"> 
the temperature <ei>T</ei> in the fragmentation process, in units of GeV. 
</parm> 
<parm name="StringPT:tempPreFactor" default="1.21" min="1.0" max="1.5"> 
Temperature prefactor for strange quarks and diquarks. Default is 
determined so as to give the same average <ei>pT</ei> in 
<ei>u/d &rarr; s</ei> and <ei>s &rarr; u/d</ei> transitions, which 
also is the reason this parameter has been introduced. 
</parm> 
 
<a name="thermFlav"></a> 
<h3>Flavour selection</h3> 
 
With the hadronic <ei>pT</ei> generated according to the thermal 
distribution, the choice of a new flavour in the fragmentation 
process, and the production of a new hadron from a set of input 
flavours, depends mainly on the hadron mass <ref>Fis16</ref>. 
For a given <ei>pT</ei> value the new flavour is chosen according to 
<eq> 
  exp( -mT_had/T) = exp( - sqrt( pT_had^2 + mT_had^2 )/T). 
</eq> 
Here <ei>T</ei> is primarily given by <code>StringPT:temperature</code>, 
but can be further modified in the context of 
<aloc href="ClosePacking">closely packed strings</aloc>, 
<code>ClosePacking:doClosePacking = on</code>. 
 
<p/> 
Additional factors are included from theory arguments, for instance 
the ratio of vector-to-pseudocalar meson production is set according 
to spin-counting rules.  The octet-singlet mixing angles in the 
light-quark meson nonets are taken the same as for Lund strings. 
Currently popcorn production has not been implemented, i.e. a baryon 
and an antibaryon are nearest neighbours in the flavour fragmentation 
chain, and share the flavours of one diquark. 
In addition the following two factors are introduced to provide an 
improved description of the flavour composition, although not as good 
as obtained in the default Gaussian scenario, with its bigger selection 
of free parameters. 
 
<p/> 
<parm name="StringFlav:BtoMratio" default="0.357" min="0.1" max="10.0"> 
Ratio of the relative rate of baryon to meson production, i.e. every 
baryon Clebsch-Gordan coefficient gets multiplied by this factor. 
</parm> 
 
<p/> 
<parm name="StringFlav:StrangeSuppression" default="0.5" min="0.01" max="1.0"> 
Extra suppression factor for strange quarks. Note that in case of more 
than one strange quark in the hadron the factor gets squared or tripled 
respectively. 
</parm> 
 
<p/> 
The following parameters are used to determine which hadrons to choose 
from. By default only the pseudoscalar and vector meson nonet (L=0) 
and baryons with u/d/s quarks are included. For an already-existing 
heavier flavour, say c or b, this corresponds to picking only u/d/s 
for the new quark(s). 
<note>Note:</note> The computer time for selecting the flavour of new 
hadrons goes linearly with the number of hadrons included. Therefore 
we recommend sticking to the default options as heavier hadrons are 
produced less likely anyway. 
 
<mode name="StringFlav:nQuark" default="3" min="3" max="5"> 
Selects the newly produced quark flavours that may be included in hadrons. 
The default corresponds to only include u/d/s quarks. 
</mode> 
 
<flag name="StringFlav:mesonNonetL1" default="off"> 
Switch on to include the pseudovector, scalar, pseudovector, and tensor 
nonet (L=1). 
</flag>
