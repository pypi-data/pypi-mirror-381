@check(
    id="mandatory_glyphs",
    rationale="""
        The OpenType specification v1.8.2 recommends that the first glyph is the
        '.notdef' glyph without a codepoint assigned and with a drawing:

        The .notdef glyph is very important for providing the user feedback
        that a glyph is not found in the font. This glyph should not be left
        without an outline as the user will only see what looks like a space
        if a glyph is missing and not be aware of the active fontâ€™s limitation.

        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/recom#glyph-0-the-notdef-glyph

        Pre-v1.8, it was recommended that fonts should also contain 'space', 'CR'
        and '.null' glyphs. This might have been relevant for MacOS 9 applications.
