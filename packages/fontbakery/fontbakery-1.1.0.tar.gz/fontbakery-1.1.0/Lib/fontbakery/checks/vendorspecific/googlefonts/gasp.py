        Traditionally version 0 'gasp' tables were set so that font sizes below 8 ppem
        had no grid fitting but did have antialiasing. From 9-16 ppem, just grid
        fitting.
        And fonts above 17ppem had both antialiasing and grid fitting toggled on.
        The use of accelerated graphics cards and higher resolution screens make this
        approach obsolete. Microsoft's DirectWrite pushed this even further with much
        improved rendering built into the OS and apps.

        In this scenario it makes sense to simply toggle all 4 flags ON for all font
        sizes.
