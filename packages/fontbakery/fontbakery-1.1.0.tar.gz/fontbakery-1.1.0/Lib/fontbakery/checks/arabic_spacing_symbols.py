        Unicode has a few spacing symbols representing Arabic dots and other marks,
        but they are purposefully not classified as marks.

        Many fonts mistakenly classify them as marks, making them unsuitable
        for their original purpose as stand-alone symbols to used in pedagogical
        contexts discussing Arabic consonantal marks.
