refactor documents in docs/env.

focus on following:
- remove redundant details
- utilize mkdocs feature to enhance intuitiveness (see mkdocs.yml)
- insert appropriate references for document, separating boundary per document appropriately(e.g. for CLI usage, do not describe too much detail if it's needed, just show some core necessary example and link to CLI reference)
- be consistent if similar contents are repeated(e.g. documents per each EnvPlugins)

note to modify OWA's Env-related contents also in docs/index.md or README.md in root directory.
