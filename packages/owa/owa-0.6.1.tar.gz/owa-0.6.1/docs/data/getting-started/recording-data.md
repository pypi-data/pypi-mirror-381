## What is ocap?

**ocap** (Omnimodal CAPture) captures all essential desktop signals in synchronized format. Records screen video, audio, keyboard/mouse input, and window events. Built for the _open-world-agents_ project but works for any desktop recording needs.

> **TL;DR**: Complete, high-performance desktop recording tool for Windows. Captures everything in one command.

## Key Features

- **Complete desktop recording**: Video, audio, keyboard/mouse events, window events
- **High performance**: Hardware-accelerated with Windows APIs and [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)
- **Efficient encoding**: [H265/HEVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding) for high quality and small file size
- **Simple operation**: `ocap FILE_LOCATION` (stop with Ctrl+C)
- **Clean architecture**: Core logic in [single 320-line Python file](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/blob/main/projects/ocap/owa/ocap/recorder.py)
- **Modern formats**: MKV with embedded timestamps, [MCAP format](https://mcap.dev/) for events

## System Requirements

Based on OBS Studio recommended specs + NVIDIA GPU requirements:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **OS** | Windows 11 (64-bit) |
| **Processor** | Intel i7 8700K / AMD Ryzen 1600X |
| **Memory** | 8 GB RAM |
| **Graphics** | **NVIDIA GeForce 10 Series or newer** ⚠️ |
| **DirectX** | Version 11 |
| **Storage** | 600 MB + ~100MB per minute recording |

> ⚠️ **NVIDIA GPU Required**: Currently only supports NVIDIA GPUs for hardware acceleration. AMD/Intel GPU support possible through GStreamer framework - **contributions welcome**!

> 🖥️ **OS Support**: Currently only supports Windows. However, support for other operating systems (Linux, macOS) can be relatively easily extended due to the presence of GStreamer. Simply using different GStreamer pipelines can enable capture on other platforms - **contributions welcome**!

## Installation & Usage

### Option 1: Download Release

- **Easy to verify**: Extensive [OWA's Env](../env/index.md) design enables customizable [`recorder.py`](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/blob/main/projects/ocap/owa/ocap/recorder.py)
- **Native performance**: Direct Windows API integration ([DXGI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-dxgi)/[WGC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.graphics.capture?view=winrt-26100), [WASAPI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/coreaudio/wasapi))

## Troubleshooting

- **Record terminates right after start?** Re-run the same command a few times. This is due to an intermittent GStreamer crash with an unknown cause.
- **GStreamer error message box appears on first run?** This is a known issue where GStreamer may show error dialogs the first time you run `ocap`. These messages do not affect recording—simply close the dialogs and continue. `ocap` will function normally.
- **Audio not recording?** By default, only audio from the target process is recorded. To change this, manually edit the [GStreamer pipeline](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/blob/fbbfdd8d3b5f9695cf295e860467776575fb1046/projects/owa-env-gst/owa/env/gst/pipeline_builder/factory.py#L71).
- **Large file sizes?** Reduce file size by adjusting the [`gop-size`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/nvcodec/nvd3d11h265enc.html?gi-language=c#nvd3d11h265enc:gop-size) parameter in the `nvd3d11h265enc` element. See [pipeline.py](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/blob/3b339897ed8eb15ac04b527c0ef1fb5baf52a2e2/projects/owa-env-gst/owa/env/gst/pipeline_builder/pipeline.py).
- **Performance tips:** Close unnecessary applications before recording, use SSD storage for better write performance, and record to a different drive than your OS drive.

## FAQ

- **How much disk space do recordings use?** ~100MB per minute for 1080p H265 recording.
- **Can I customize recorded events?** Yes. Enable/disable audio, keyboard, mouse, and window events individually. Since [recorder.py](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/blob/main/projects/ocap/owa/ocap/recorder.py) is just a 320-line single python script, you may customize it easily.
- **Will ocap slow down my computer?** Minimal impact with hardware acceleration. Designed for low overhead.
- **What formats are supported?** MKV with H265/HEVC encoding for video and MCAP format for events for efficient storage and querying is supported, but you may customize it easily. (e.g. saving `jsonl` instead of `mcap` file takes minimal effort by editing [recorder.py](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/blob/main/projects/ocap/owa/ocap/recorder.py))

## When to Use ocap

- **Agent training**: Capture all inputs and outputs for AI training
- **Workflow documentation**: Record exact steps with precise timing
- **Performance testing**: Low-overhead recording during intensive tasks
- **Complete screen recording**: When you need more than just video
