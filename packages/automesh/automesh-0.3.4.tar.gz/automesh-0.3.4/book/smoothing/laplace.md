# Laplace Smoothing

## Double X

We examine the most basic type of smoothing, Laplace smoothing, $\lambda = 0.3$,
without hierarchical control, with the **Double X** example.

Table. The *neighborhoods table*. A node, with its neighbors, is considered a single neighborhood.  The table has twelve neighborhoods.

node | node neighbors
:---: | :---:
1  | 2, 4, 7
2  | 1, 3, 5, 8
3  | 2, 6, 9
4  | 1, 5, 10
5  | 2, 4, 6, 11
6  | 3, 5, 12
7  | 1, 8, 10
8  | 2, 7, 9, 11
9  | 3, 8, 12
10 | 4, 7, 11
11 | 5, 8, 10, 12
12 | 6, 9, 11

### Hierarchy

Following is a test where all nodes are `BOUNDARY` from the [`Hierarchy`](../../theory/smoothing.md#the-hierarchy-enum) enum.

```python
node_hierarchy: NodeHierarchy = (
    Hierarchy.BOUNDARY,
    Hierarchy.BOUNDARY,
    Hierarchy.BOUNDARY,
    Hierarchy.BOUNDARY,
    Hierarchy.BOUNDARY,
    Hierarchy.BOUNDARY,
    Hierarchy.BOUNDARY,
    Hierarchy.BOUNDARY,
    Hierarchy.BOUNDARY,
    Hierarchy.BOUNDARY,
    Hierarchy.BOUNDARY,
    Hierarchy.BOUNDARY,
)
```

> Since there are no `INTERIOR` nodes nor `PRESCRIBED` nodes, the effect of hiearchical smoothing is nill, and the same effect would be observed were all nodes categorized as `INTERIOR` nodes.


### Iteration `1`

Table: The smoothed configuration `(x, y, z)` after one iteration of Laplace smoothing.

node | `x` | `y` | `z`
:---: | :--- | :--- | :---
1 | 0.1 | 0.1 |0.1
2 | 1.0 | 0.075 | 0.075
3 | 1.9 | 0.1 |0.1
4 | 0.1 | 0.9 | 0.1
5 | 1.0 | 0.925 | 0.075
6 | 1.9 | 0.9 | 0.1
7 | 0.1 | 0.1 |0.9
8 | 1.0 | 0.075 | 0.925
9 | 1.9 | 0.1 | 0.9
10 | 0.1 | 0.9 | 0.9
11 | 1.0 | 0.925 | 0.925
12 | 1.9 | 0.9 | 0.9

:---: | :--- | :--- | :---
1  | 0.19 | 0.1775 | 0.1775

### Iteration `100`

A known drawback of Laplace smoothing is that it can fail to preserve volumes.  In the limit, volumes get reduced to a point, as illustrated in the figure below.
