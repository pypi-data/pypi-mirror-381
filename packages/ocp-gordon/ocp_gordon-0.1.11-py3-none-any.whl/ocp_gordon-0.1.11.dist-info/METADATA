# Gordon Surface Library for CadQuery's OCP

This library provides a Python implementation for creating Gordon surfaces, a method for interpolating a network of curves to generate a smooth surface. It is designed to be compatible with CadQuery's OCP and leverages B-spline mathematics.

The implementation is written entirely in Python and is adapted from the original C++ code in [occ_gordon](https://github.com/rainman110/occ_gordon)

## Features

- Gordon surface interpolation from profile and guide curves.
- Compatibility with B-spline representations.
- Integration with CadQuery's OCP (OpenCASCADE Python) for geometric primitives.

## Installation

This package can be installed using pip.

```bash
pip install ocp_gordon
```

## Dependencies

- OCP (OpenCASCADE Python)
- NumPy
- SciPy

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the library:

```python
# Assume you have profile_curves and guide_curves defined as lists of B-spline objects
# profile_curves = [...] # List of Geom_BSplineCurve objects
# guide_curves = [...]   # List of Geom_BSplineCurve objects

from ocp_gordon import interpolate_curve_network

gordon_surface = interpolate_curve_network(profile_curves, guide_curves, tolerance=0.0003)

```

For more detailed examples, please refer to the `examples/` directory in the source code.

## Test

To run tests, first install pytest, then:

```bash
cd tests
python test_all.py

```

## Notable Difference from C++ Code

- In `intersect_bsplines.py`, a polyfilled `math_BFGS` is used instead of `math_FRPR`. Both `math_BFGS` and `math_FRPR` are not usable in OCP because OCP does not expose `math_Vector`. The `activate()` function in this file has also been changed since the original one does not work well. In `IntersectBSplines` function, first check if the intersection occurs at the end points before using 2d minimizer.
- In the `_solve()` function in `bspline_approx_interp.py`, the regularization is added to prevent singular matrix which occurs in some cases for example when the input curve is a bspline converted from a circle.
- A new file `misc.py` is added to implement some missing classes/functions from OCP. The major ones are `clone_bspline` and `math_BFGS`.

## Caveats

- In the `IntersectBSplines` function, the 2d minimizer does not work well when the number of profile/guides is high (>5). Increase the `tolerance` parameter in `interpolate_curve_network` can help.
