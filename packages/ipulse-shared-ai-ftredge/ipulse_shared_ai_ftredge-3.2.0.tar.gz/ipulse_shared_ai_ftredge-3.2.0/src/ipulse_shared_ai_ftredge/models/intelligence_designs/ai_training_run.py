    üèÉ AI TRAINING RUN - The Actual Execution
    
    CORE CONCEPT:
    This captures the EXACT details of a single training execution - what data was actually used,
    what happened during training, what was the result. This is the "what really happened" record.
    
    KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
    ‚Ä¢ ONE training configuration ‚Üí MULTIPLE training runs (over time)
    ‚Ä¢ ONE training run ‚Üí ZERO or ONE model version (if successful)
    ‚Ä¢ ONE training run CAN BE USED BY multiple training configurations (shared runs)
    
    SHARED TRAINING RUNS:
    Training runs can be shared between multiple training configurations:
    ‚úÖ Initial training: Both "daily retrain" and "weekly retrain" configs use same initial run
    ‚úÖ Complete retraining: Multiple configs can share the same full retrain run
    ‚ùå Fine-tuning runs: Usually NOT shared as models diverge after different training schedules
    
    DATA PRECISION:
    ‚Ä¢ Training Config: "Use market data from last 2 years" (blueprint)
    ‚Ä¢ Training Run: "Used market_data_v2.3, 2022-01-15 to 2024-01-15, 45,231 records" (actual)
    
    TRACKING VALUE:
    By comparing training runs from different configs, we can answer:
    ‚Ä¢ Does daily retraining improve performance vs weekly?
    ‚Ä¢ What's the cost/benefit of more frequent updates?
    ‚Ä¢ Which training frequency gives best ROI?
