    ðŸ“¦ AI MODEL VERSION - The Trained Implementation

    CORE CONCEPT:
    Represents a specific, trained instance of an AI model that is ready for deployment.
    This is the successful result of executing a training configuration against a model 
    specification, producing a versioned artifact ready for serving.

    KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
    â€¢ ONE model specification (AIModelSpecification) â†’ MULTIPLE model versions
    â€¢ ONE training configuration â†’ MULTIPLE model versions (over time)
    â€¢ ONE training run â†’ ZERO or ONE model version (if training succeeded)
    â€¢ ONE model version â†’ MULTIPLE serving instances (AIModelServingInstance)

    VERSION LINEAGE & EVOLUTION:
    Model versions form evolutionary lineages through parent_version_id:
    â€¢ Base Model: v1.0.0 (initial training from specification)
    â€¢ Retrained: v1.1.0 â†’ v1.2.0 â†’ v1.3.0 (scheduled retraining cycles)
    â€¢ Fine-tuned: v1.1.1 â†’ v1.1.2 (incremental improvements)
    â€¢ Branched: v2.0.0 (architectural changes or new training approach)

    TRAINING INTEGRATION:
    â€¢ training_config_id: Links to the training plan that produced this version
    â€¢ training_run_id: Links to the specific execution that created this artifact
    â€¢ parent_version_id: Links to previous version for lineage tracking
    â€¢ External models: These fields are null as training occurs outside our control

    EXTERNAL MODEL VERSIONING:
    For third-party models (GPT, Gemini, Claude), versions track:
    â€¢ API endpoint configurations and authentication setup
    â€¢ Structured output schemas and inference parameters  
    â€¢ Performance benchmarks and cost optimization settings
    â€¢ Fallback strategies and reliability monitoring

    LIFECYCLE STATES (version_status):
    DRAFT â†’ TRAINING â†’ TRAINED â†’ VALIDATED â†’ DEPLOYED â†’ SERVING â†’ RETIRED
    
    DEPLOYMENT PATTERN:
    Version artifacts remain immutable. Deployment and hosting details are managed
    by AIModelServingInstance to support:
    â€¢ Multi-region deployments (same version in multiple regions)
    â€¢ A/B testing (same version with different configurations)
    â€¢ Environment separation (staging vs production)
    â€¢ Multiple hosting patterns (persistent, ephemeral, hybrid)

    PERFORMANCE TRACKING:
    Each version tracks real-world performance to enable:
    â€¢ Comparative analysis between training frequencies/approaches
    â€¢ Performance degradation detection over time
    â€¢ ROI analysis of different training strategies
    â€¢ Cost optimization for external model usage
    â€¢ Automated rollback triggers for quality control

    ARTIFACT MANAGEMENT:
    â€¢ model_artifact_location: Physical storage of trained model (GCS, S3, etc.)
    â€¢ model_artifact_checksum: Integrity verification for deployments
    â€¢ model_artifact_format: Serialization format (pickle, ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel)
    â€¢ artifact_size_mb: Resource planning and transfer optimization
