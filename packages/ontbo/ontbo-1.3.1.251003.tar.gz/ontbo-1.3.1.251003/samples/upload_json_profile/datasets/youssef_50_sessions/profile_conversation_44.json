For example, a quinoa salad with chickpeas and mixed veggies provides a great protein source.\n\n2. **Healthy Fats:**\n   - **Sources:** Avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and nut butters.\n   - **Combination:** Include healthy fats in each meal to help with satiety and nutrient absorption. For example, add avocado to your salads or use olive oil in your cooking.\n\n3. **Complex Carbohydrates:**\n   - **Sources:** Quinoa, brown rice, sweet potatoes, and gluten-free oats.\n   - **Combination:** Focus on whole grains that provide fiber and energy. Pair them with proteins and vegetables for balanced meals.

For example, a stir-fry with multiple veggies or a fruit salad with different types of fruits.\n\n5. **Fiber:**\n   - **Sources:** Whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables.\n   - **Combination:** Incorporate high-fiber foods in your meals. For example, make a lentil soup filled with vegetables or a quinoa salad with added beans.\n\n### Nutritional Tips:\n\n- **Variety is Key:** Incorporate a variety of foods throughout the week to cover a broader spectrum of nutrients. Rotating your vegetables and proteins can help achieve this.\n- **Meal Combinations:** Use combinations that include a protein, healthy fat, and fiber-rich carbs. For instance, a meal with brown rice, grilled chicken, and steamed broccoli drizzled with olive oil.\n- **Watch Portion Sizes:** While it\u2019s important to eat a variety of foods, pay attention to portion sizes to ensure you\u2019re not overeating or undereating any particular food group.\n- **Hydration:** Don't forget to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Herbal teas or infused water with fruits can be a nice addition!\n- **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to how different foods make you feel.
