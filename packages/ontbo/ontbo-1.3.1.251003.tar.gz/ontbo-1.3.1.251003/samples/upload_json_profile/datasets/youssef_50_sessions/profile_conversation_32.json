Here are some tips to help you arrange your songs for the best flow:\n\n1. **Start Slow, Build Up:** Begin with a couple of warm-up tracks that are moderate in tempo. This allows you to ease into your workout.\n\n2. **Increase the Tempo:** Gradually increase the energy and tempo of the songs as your workout progresses. This helps to build excitement and motivation.\n\n3. **Peak Intensity:** Include your most energizing and upbeat tracks during the peak of your workout\u2014when you're pushing yourself the hardest. These should be your go-to pump-up songs.\n\n4. **Cool Down Tracks:** After your peak, gradually decrease the tempo with some slightly slower songs to help you cool down and recover. \n\n5. **Mix It Up:** Include a variety of genres and styles within your rock and electronic preferences to keep things interesting and prevent monotony.\n\n6. **Create a Narrative:** Think of your playlist as a journey. You can create a narrative that mirrors your workout routine, allowing the music to guide you through different phases.\n\n7. **Test and Adjust:** Don\u2019t hesitate to test your playlist during different workouts. If a song doesn\u2019t feel right, switch it out. It\u2019s all about what works best for you!\n\n8. **Duration:** Aim for a playlist length that matches your workout time. If you know you\u2019ll be exercising for an hour, try to curate around that duration.\n\n9. **Personal Favorites:** Make sure to include your all-time favorite songs, as they can boost your motivation and keep you engaged.\n\nWould you like help in crafting a specific playlist based on these tips, or do you have any other questions?",
