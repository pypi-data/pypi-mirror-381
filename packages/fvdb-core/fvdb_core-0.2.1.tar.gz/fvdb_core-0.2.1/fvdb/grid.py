Single sparse grid data structure and operations for FVDB.

This module provides the core Grid class for managing a single sparse voxel grid:

Classes:
- Grid: A single sparse voxel grid with support for efficient operations

Class-methods for creating Grid objects from various sources:
- Grid.from_dense() for dense data
- Grid.from_dense_axis_aligned_bounds() for dense defined by axis-aligned bounds
- Grid.from_grid_batch() for a single grid from a grid batch
- Grid.from_ijk() for voxel coordinates
- Grid.from_mesh() for triangle meshes
- Grid.from_nearest_voxels_to_points() for nearest voxel mapping
- Grid.from_points() for point clouds
- Grid.from_zero_voxels() for a single grid with zero voxels

Module-level functions for loading and saving grids:
- load_grid/save_grid: Load and save grids to/from .nvdb files

Grid supports operations like convolution, pooling, interpolation, ray casting,
mesh extraction, and coordinate transformations on sparse voxel data.

    A single sparse voxel grid with support for efficient operations.

    Grid represents a single sparse 3D voxel grid that can be processed
    efficiently on a GPU. The class provides methods for common operations like
    sampling, convolution, pooling, and other operations.

    A Grid cannot be a nonexistent (grid_count==0) grid, for that you'd need a
    GridBatch with batch_size=0. However, a Grid can have zero voxels.

    The grid is stored in a sparse format where only active (non-empty) voxels are
    allocated, making it memory efficient for representing large volumes with sparse
    occupancy.

    Note:
        For creating grids with actual content, use the classmethods:
        - Grid.from_dense() for dense data
        - Grid.from_dense_axis_aligned_bounds() for dense defined by axis-aligned bounds
        - Grid.from_grid_batch() for a single grid from a grid batch
        - Grid.from_ijk() for voxel coordinates
        - Grid.from_mesh() for triangle meshes
        - Grid.from_nearest_voxels_to_points() for nearest voxel mapping
        - Grid.from_points() for point clouds
        - Grid.from_zero_voxels() for a single grid with zero voxels

        The Grid constructor is for internal use only, always use the classmethods.
