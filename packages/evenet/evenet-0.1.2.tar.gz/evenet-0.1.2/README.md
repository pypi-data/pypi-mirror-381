EveNet is a pretrained, multi-task foundation model for event-level collider physics. 
It comes with a scalable Ray + PyTorch Lightning training pipeline, SLURM-ready multi-GPU infrastructure, 
and modular YAML configuration, 
so researchers can quickly fine-tune it on their own datasets and extend it to new physics analyses.
