# Installation
```
pip install acom_music_box
```

If you would like GPU support, you must first add the [NVIDIA pypi index](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-quick-start-guide/#pip-wheels-linux) and then you can specify the
gpu install option for music box.

```
pip install --upgrade setuptools pip wheel
pip install nvidia-pyindex
pip install acom_music_box[gpu]
```

# Using the MusicBox API

MusicBox makes its chemical mechanism analysis and visualization available through a Python API. The following example works through solving a simple chemistry system. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://ncar.github.io/music-box/branch/main/index.html) for further tutorials and examples.
```python
# Import MusicBox, MusicBox conditions, and Musica mechanisms:

from acom_music_box import MusicBox, Conditions
import musica.mechanism_configuration as mc                                      


# Define the chemical system of interest

# MusicBox uses Musica (https://ncar.github.io/musica/index.html) to create specific chemical species and phases of interest for chemical mechanisms.

A = mc.Species(name="A")
B = mc.Species(name="B")
C = mc.Species(name="C")  

species = {"A":A, "B":B, "C":C}

gas = mc.Phase(name="gas", species=list(species.values()))

# Define a mechanism of interest

# Through Musica, several different mechanisms can be explored to define reaction rates. Here, we use the Arrhenius equation as a simple example.

arr1 = mc.Arrhenius(name="A->B", A=4.0e-3, C=50,reactants=[species["A"]], products=[species["B"]], gas_phase=gas)  

arr2 = mc.Arrhenius(name="B->C", A=1.2e-4, B=2.5, C=75, D=50, E=0.5, reactants=[species["B"]], products=[species["C"]], gas_phase=gas)

mechanism = mc.Mechanism(name="test_mechanism", species=list(species.values()),phases=[gas], reactions=[arr1, arr2])


# Create a box model

# To create a box model, including its mechanisms, conditions, length, time, and step times:

box_model = MusicBox()
box_model.load_mechanism(mechanism)


# In the box model, the initial set of conditions represent the starting environment for the reactions.
# Both initial and evolving conditions are typically created alongside the creation of the box model:

box_model.initial_conditions = Conditions(temperature=300.0, pressure=101000.0, species_concentrations={ "A": 1.0, "B": 3.0, "C": 5.0})


# Evolving conditions represent a set of environmental and species values or rate constants that the box model should use at a specific time step.
# The following adds an evolving condition to the model, the first float represents the time when the condition evolves:

box_model.add_evolving_condition(300.0,Conditions(temperature=290.0, pressure=100200.0, species_concentrations={"A": 1.0, "B": 3.0, "C": 10.0}))

box_model.box_model_options.simulation_length = 20 # total simulation time
box_model.box_model_options.chem_step_time = 1 # time step for chemical reaction
box_model.box_model_options.output_step_time = 4 # time step between each output


# Solve your newly-created box model and view results:

df = box_model.solve()
print(df)

# To visualize specific results:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df.plot(x='time.s', y=['CONC.A.mol m-3', 'CONC.B.mol m-3', 'CONC.C.mol m-3'], title='Concentration over time', ylabel='Concentration (mol m-3)', xlabel='Time (s)')
plt.show()

```

# Command line tool
MusicBox provides a command line tool that can run configurations as well as some pre-configured examples. Basic plotting can be done with matplotlib.

Checkout the command line options

```
music_box -h                                        
```

Run an example. Notice that the output, in csv format, is printed to the terminal.

```
music_box -e Chapman
```

Output can be saved to a csv file (the default format) and printed to the terminal.

```
music_box -e Chapman -o output
```

Output can be saved to a csv file by specifying the .csv extension for Comma-Separated Values.

```
music_box -e Chapman -o output.csv
```

Output can be saved to a file as netcdf file by specifying the .nc file extension.

```
music_box -e Chapman -o output.nc
```

Output can be saved to a file in csv format when a filename is not specified. In this case a timestamped csv file is made.

```
music_box -e Chapman
```

You may also specify multiple output files with different formats, using the file extension.

```
music_box -e Analytical -o results.csv -o results.nc
```

You can also run your own configuration

```
music_box -c my_config.json
```

## Plotting
Some basic plots can be made to show concentrations throughout the simulation using matplotlib.

```
music_box -e Chapman -o output.csv --plot O1D
```

You can also make multiple plots by specifying groupings of species

```
music_box -e TS1 --plot O3 --plot PAN,HF 
```

Note that the windows may overlap each other

By default all plot units are in `mol m-3`. You can see a list of unit options to specify with `--plot-output-unit`

```
music_box -h
```

It is used like this

```
 music_box -e TS1 --plot O3 --plot-output-unit "ppb"
```

# Development and Contributing
