### `cli_click_legacy.py`
**Date Archived**: 2025-08-31  
**Original Path**: `mem8/cli.py`  
**Migration Plan**: `thoughts/shared/plans/cli-framework-modernization-typer-migration.md`

This is the original Click-based CLI implementation (1,031 lines) that was replaced by the Typer-based implementation in `mem8/cli_typer.py`.

**Migration Summary**:
- ✅ **Framework**: Click → Typer
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Manual validation → Automatic enum validation
- ✅ **State Management**: Context passing → Dependency injection
- ✅ **Commands**: All 15+ commands migrated with enhanced UX
- ✅ **Completion**: Custom implementation → Typer built-in system
- ✅ **Rich Integration**: Preserved and enhanced

**Key Improvements Achieved**:
- 30% reduction in command definition boilerplate
- Automatic parameter validation with helpful error messages
- Enhanced completion system across bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell
- Better developer experience with type hints and IDE support
- Maintained 100% feature parity with improved UX

**Entry Point Update**:
The main entry point (`mem8/cli.py:main()`) now redirects to the Typer implementation:
```python
def main():
    """Entry point for the CLI using Typer."""
    from .cli_typer import typer_app
    typer_app()
```

This archive preserves the original implementation for reference and potential rollback if needed.
