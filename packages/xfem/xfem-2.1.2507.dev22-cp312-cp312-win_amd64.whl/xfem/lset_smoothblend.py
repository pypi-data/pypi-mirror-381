class LevelSet_SmoothBlending:
    """
    Class to supply the user with an automatically calculated smooth blending function b
    used in LevelSetMeshAdaptation_Spacetime objects. Call the constructor of this class to obtain
    an object with the member function CF, which is the sought-after b prepared for you by the
    constructor. The constructor shall be called with a blending type, either BLEND_FIXED_WIDTH
    or BLEND_AUTODETECT, as the first argument and a dictionary with options as the second argument.
    What shall be supplied in the dictionary differs by the blending types.

    About the two blending types in detail:

    * BLEND_FIXED_WIDTH. Required keys in the dict: { "lset": CF, "order": int , "width": float}
      In this case, the blending is assumed to decay with a fixed width w. The cut topology (time
      dependent or not) is specified by the lset Coefficientfunction. Starting from those points
      with lset=0 on the cut interface, we assume that the lset function is a measure of the
      distance from the interface. (If it is only equivalent to such a function up to a non-
      degenerating constant this is not a problem, only to the extend that the resulting width
      might eventually differ by the same constant from w) If the distance ("measured" as such)
      is between 0 and w, b equals 0. If the distance is between w and 2*w, the blending will
      increase from 0 to 1 by the polynomial pi_s of order order as defined in
      https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02348. For distances greater than 2*w, b=1,
      asking for a zero deformation.

    * BLEND_AUTODETECT. Required keys in the dict: { "lset": CF, "order": int, "mesh": mesh,
                                                    "time_order": int}
      In this function, the overall structure of the BLEND_FIXED_WIDTH remains the same.
      However, the parameter w does not have to be provided explicitely. Instead, it is evaluted
      by a numerical estimate of all the cut elements inside the current time slice as prescribed
      by lset. To this extend, the further arguments of a mesh and a time_order are needed.
      The latter is used to generate sampling points in time for the maximum distance estimation.
      This means that e.g. time_order 1 or 2 would be typical reasonable choices.
