class SingleTimeEvent(TimeEvent):
    """
    SingleTimeEvent class represents all events associated with one specific date time (e.g. 2017-05-13 13:00),
    which will never be repeated in the future.

    This type of events is mostly used along with data being passed between different components. In order to schedule
    new single time event, schedule_new_event function should be used. This will add a predefined datetime parameter
    along with necessary data to the _datetimes_to_data dictionary.

    SingleTimeEvent uses a class method for new events scheduling and a static dictionary _datetimes_to_data, as
    Scheduler requires types of events in subscription function (the listener subscribes to type of time event,
    represented usually by a class, not to a certain time event object).
