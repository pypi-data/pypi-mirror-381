    The ExecutionHandler abstract class handles the interaction
    between a set of order objects and the set of Transaction
    objects that actually occur in the market.

    The handlers can be used to subclass simulated brokerages
    or live brokerages, with identical interfaces. This allows
    strategies to be backtested in a very similar manner to the
    live trading engine.

    ExecutionHandler can link to an optional Compliance component
    for simple record-keeping, which will keep track of all executed
    orders.
