    Takes a vector of weights and a vector of upper constraints (both of the same length) and ensures that no weights
    exceed their upper constraints. It is done iteratively by cutting the weights exceeding the upper bound
    and rescaling the weights vector so that the weights sum up to 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weights
        vector of weights
    upper_constraints
        vector of upper constraints
    max_iter
        maximal number of iterations done for adjusting the weights vector. If the max_iter number of iterations
        is exceeded, the proper warning is given
    epsilon
        a difference between original weight and a new one which is considered to be equal to no change

    Returns
    -------
    vector of new weights which satisfy their upper bound constraints
