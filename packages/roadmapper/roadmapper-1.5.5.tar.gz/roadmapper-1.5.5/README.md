# Roadmaper - an open source Roadmap as Code (RaC) python library

## Purpose
The purpose of roadmapper python library is used to draw roadmap by using python code. This is the first Roadmap as Code (RaC) library. RaC helps to create and edit roadmap in a more efficient way without having to use any graphical tools that are not always easy to use to create or update a roadmap.

With git repository like GitHub or Bitbucket, roadmaps created using RaC can be version controlled, track changes and can be easily shared with others.

:book: For usage documentation, how-to guide and code examples, refer to [Roadmapper Wiki](https://github.com/csgoh/roadmap-generator/wiki).

## Code Example
:point_right: Note: In order for the following code to work, you will need to download the `matariki-tech-logo.png` file to your local storage. The png file can be downloaded from the `\images\logo\` folder.

```python
from roadmapper.roadmap import Roadmap
from roadmapper.timelinemode import TimelineMode

roadmap = Roadmap(1200, 400, colour_theme="BLUEMOUNTAIN")
roadmap.set_title("My Demo Roadmap")
roadmap.set_subtitle("Matariki Technologies Ltd")
roadmap.set_timeline(TimelineMode.MONTHLY, start="2025-01-01", number_of_items=18)
roadmap.add_logo(
    "matariki-tech-logo.png",
    position="top-right",
    width=50,
    height=50,
)

group = roadmap.add_group("Core Product Work Stream")

task = group.add_task("Base Functionality", "2025-01-01", "2025-10-31")
task.add_milestone("v.1.0", "2025-02-15")
task.add_milestone("v.1.1", "2025-08-01")

parellel_task = task.add_parallel_task("Enhancements", "2025-11-15", "2026-03-31")
parellel_task.add_milestone("v.2.0", "2026-03-30")

task = group.add_task("Showcase #1", "2025-03-01", "2025-05-07")
task.add_parallel_task("Showcase #2", "2025-06-01", "2025-08-07")

roadmap.set_footer("Generated by Roadmapper")

roadmap.save("demo01.png")
```
