    Enumerator to modify the looping cycle.

    In the case of a looping Processor, the user has the ability to slightly modify the looping structure using this
    enumerator.

    In the :meth:`~mafw.processor.Processor.process` the user can set the variable `looping_status` to one of the following values:

    - :attr:`LoopingStatus.Continue`. It means that everything is working well and the loop cycle must go ahead as
      foreseen and the :meth:`~mafw.processor.Processor.accept_item` will be invoked.

    - :attr:`LoopingStatus.Skip`. The :meth:`~mafw.processor.Processor.skip_item` will be called soon after the
      :meth:`~mafw.processor.Processor.process` is finished. The status will be reset to Continue and the next item will be processed.

    - :attr:`LoopingStatus.Abort`. The cycle is broken immediately.

    - :attr:`LoopingStatus.Quit`. The cycle is broken immediately.

    The last two options are apparently identical, but they offer the possibility to implement a different behaviour
    in the :meth:`~mafw.processor.Processor.finish` method. When abort is used, then the
    :class:`~mafw.mafw_errors.AbortProcessorException` will be raised. For example, the user can decide to rollback
    all changes if an abort as occurred or to save what done so far in case of a quit.

           loop is based on a list of elements, the user **must** overload the :meth:`~mafw.processor.Processor.get_items`
           method to define the list of items for the loop.

        #. **While loop mode.** The process method is executed inside a while loop after the start and before the finish.

        <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/free-threading-python.html>`_ of future python releases, this concurrent
        looping strategy might be based on threads or a porting of the ``autorad`` multi-processor approach.
