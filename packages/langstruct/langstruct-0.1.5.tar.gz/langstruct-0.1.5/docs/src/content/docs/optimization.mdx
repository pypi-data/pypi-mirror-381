Make your extraction more accurate with automatic optimization. LangStruct learns from your data to improve results without any manual prompt engineering.

## The Easy Way

**Create an extractor (optionally choose the optimizer) and call `optimize()` when you're ready:**

```python
from langstruct import LangStruct

extractor = LangStruct(
  example={
    "name": "Dr. Sarah Johnson",
    "age": 34,
    "occupation": "data scientist"
  },
  optimizer="miprov2",  # default optimizer
)

# Later, once you have training data:
# extractor.optimize(texts=training_texts, expected_results=good_results)
```

**Quick experiments (skip optimization entirely):**

```python
extractor = LangStruct(example={"name": "John", "age": 30})
```

## When You Have Training Data

If you have examples of what good extraction looks like, run optimization explicitly:

```python
# Your training examples
training_texts = [
    "Dr. Sarah Johnson, 34, is a data scientist",
    "Prof. Michael Chen, 45, teaches at MIT",
    "Emma Wilson, 28, software engineer"
]

# What the results should look like
good_results = [
    {"name": "Dr. Sarah Johnson", "age": 34, "occupation": "data scientist"},
    {"name": "Prof. Michael Chen", "age": 45, "occupation": "professor"},
    {"name": "Emma Wilson", "age": 28, "occupation": "software engineer"}
]

# Train it to be better
extractor.optimize(texts=training_texts, expected_results=good_results)

# Now it's optimized for your specific use case
result = extractor.extract("Jane Smith, 29, works as a designer")
```

## How Much Better?

Optimization can significantly improve accuracy on real-world tasks:

	<Card title="After Optimization" icon="approve-check">
		Improved performance - better information capture and consistency
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Persisting Results

Save and load optimized extractors to reuse them without re-running optimization:

```python
# Save after optimization
extractor.save("./my_extractor")

# Load later
from langstruct import LangStruct
loaded = LangStruct.load("./my_extractor")

# Use immediately - optimization is preserved
result = loaded.extract("new text")
```

## Advanced (If You Need It)

Most users don't need this, but if you want more control:

```python
# Fine-tune the optimization process
extractor.optimize(
    texts=training_texts,
    expected_results=good_results,
    validation_split=0.3  # Use 30% for testing improvements
)
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I always need training data?**
A: You need example texts, but not necessarily expected outputs. If you don't provide `expected_results`, LangStruct uses the LLM's confidence ratings to optimize. Providing expected outputs significantly improves accuracy.

**Q: How long does optimization take?**
A: Usually 1-5 minutes for typical datasets (10-100 examples).

**Q: Can I optimize an already optimized extractor?**
A: Yes, you can continue optimizing with new data as you collect it.

**Q: Will this make my extractions slower?**
A: No - optimization happens once during training. Production extraction speed is unchanged.

**Q: What happens when I switch models?**
A: Change the model and re-optimize with the same training data. No prompt rewriting needed.
