Thanks for sharing the `docker ps` output üôå That confirms your containers are up and mapped to host ports.

You have these published:

* `weddingdecorationramnad` ‚Üí **:2021 ‚Üí 80/tcp**
* `honestmoneyexchanger` ‚Üí **:2020 ‚Üí 80/tcp**
* `yuvanwebtech` ‚Üí **:222 ‚Üí 80/tcp**
* `uthavu-site` ‚Üí **:8081 ‚Üí 80/tcp**
* `2fcleaningsolutions-site` ‚Üí **:8080 ‚Üí 80/tcp**

So if everything was open, you should be able to load them from a browser like:

* `http://<your-server-ip>:2021`
* `http://<your-server-ip>:2020`
* `http://<your-server-ip>:222`
* `http://<your-server-ip>:8081`
* `http://<your-server-ip>:8080`

### Why they don‚Äôt load?

From the earlier screenshot, I see **UFW was blocking traffic (port 22 was blocked, same applies for 2020/2021/8080/8081/222 too)**.

Right now, the firewall is most likely blocking all incoming ports except maybe 80/443.

### üîß Fix Steps

1. **Allow your custom ports in UFW**
   Run these commands on the Debian server:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 2020/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 2021/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 222/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 8081/tcp
   ```

   If you also need HTTPS later:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
   ```

2. **Reload UFW**

   ```bash
   sudo ufw reload
   ```

3. **Check rules**

   ```bash
   sudo ufw status verbose
   ```

   You should see:

   ```
   2020/tcp   ALLOW Anywhere
   2021/tcp   ALLOW Anywhere
   222/tcp    ALLOW Anywhere
   8080/tcp   ALLOW Anywhere
   8081/tcp   ALLOW Anywhere
   ```

4. **Test access**
   Open a browser and try:

   * `http://72.60.97.244:2021`
   * `http://72.60.97.244:2020`
   * `http://72.60.97.244:222`
   * `http://72.60.97.244:8081`
   * `http://72.60.97.244:8080`

‚ö†Ô∏è Alternative: If you don‚Äôt want to expose random high ports, we can set up **Nginx reverse proxy** to forward `https://yourdomain.com` ‚Üí container ports. This way you only open **80/443** and secure them with SSL.

üëâ Jawa, do you want me to guide you in **just opening the ports** so the sites are visible quickly, or go the **Nginx + domain + SSL** route (cleaner, production-ready)?
