# ASTROMER Python library üî≠

ASTROMER is a transformer based model pretrained on millions of light curves. ASTROMER can be finetuned on specific datasets to create useful representations that can improve the performance of novel deep learning models.

‚ùó This version of ASTROMER can only works on single band light curves.

üî• [See the official repo here](https://github.com/astromer-science/main-code)

## Install
```
pip install ASTROMER
```

## How to use it
Currently, there are 2 pre-trained models: `macho` and `atlas`.
To load weights use:
```
from ASTROMER.models import SingleBandEncoder

model = SingleBandEncoder()
model = model.from_pretraining('macho')
```
It will automatically download the weights from [this public github repository](https://github.com/astromer-science/weights.git) and load them into the `SingleBandEncoder` instance.

Assuming you have a list of vary-lenght (numpy) light curves.
```
import numpy as np

samples_collection = [ np.array([[5200, 0.3, 0.2],
                                 [5300, 0.5, 0.1],
                                 [5400, 0.2, 0.3]]),

                       np.array([[4200, 0.3, 0.1],
                                 [4300, 0.6, 0.3]]) ]

```
Light curves are `Lx3` matrices with time, magnitude, and magnitude std.
To encode samples use:
```
attention_vectors = model.encode(samples_collection,
                                 oids_list=['1', '2'],
                                 batch_size=1,
                                 concatenate=True)
```
where
- `samples_collection` is a list of numpy array light curves
- `oids_list` is a list with the light curves ids (needed to concatenate 200-len windows)
- `batch_size` specify the number of samples per forward pass
-  when `concatenate=True` ASTROMER concatenates every 200-lenght windows belonging the same object id. The output when `concatenate=True` is a list of vary-length attention vectors.

## Finetuning or training from scratch
`ASTROMER` can be easly trained by using the `fit`. It include

```
from ASTROMER import SingleBandEncoder

model = SingleBandEncoder(num_layers= 2,
                          d_model   = 256,
                          num_heads = 4,
                          dff       = 128,
                          base      = 1000,
                          dropout   = 0.1,
                          maxlen    = 200)
model.from_pretrained('macho')
```
where,
- `num_layers`: Number of self-attention blocks
- `d_model`: Self-attention block dimension (must be divisible by `num_heads`)
- `num_heads`: Number of heads within the self-attention block
- `dff`: Number of neurons for the fully-connected layer applied after the attention blocks
- `base`: Positional encoder base (see formula)
- `dropout`: Dropout applied to output of the fully-connected layer
- `maxlen`: Maximum length to process in the encoder
Notice you can ignore `model.from_pretrained('macho')` for clean training.
```
mode.fit(train_data,
         validation_data,
         epochs=2,
         patience=20,
         lr=1e-3,
         project_path='./my_folder',
         verbose=0)
```
where,
- `train_data`: Training data already formatted as tf.data
- `validation_data`: Validation data already formatted as tf.data
- `epochs`: Number of epochs for training
- `patience`: Early stopping patience
- `lr`: Learning rate
- `project_path`: Path for saving weights and training logs
- `verbose`: (0) Display information during training (1) don't

`train_data` and `validation_data` should be loaded using `load_numpy` or `pretraining_records` functions. Both functions are in the `ASTROMER.preprocessing` module.

For large datasets is recommended to use Tensorflow Records ([see this tutorial to execute our data pipeline](https://github.com/astromer-science/main-code/blob/main/presentation/notebooks/create_records.ipynb))
