    #### <kbd>property</kbd> max_distance

    Distance threshold used to determine if two questions in a project are similar.
    The metric used is cosine distance. Valid threshold values range from 0 (identical vectors) to 1 (orthogonal vectors).
    While cosine distance can extend to 2 (opposite vectors), we limit this value to 1 since finding matches that are less similar than "unrelated" (orthogonal)
    content would not improve results of the system querying the Cleanlab project.
