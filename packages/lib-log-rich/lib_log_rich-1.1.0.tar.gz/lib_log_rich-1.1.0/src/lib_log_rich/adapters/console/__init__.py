"""Console adapter exports for Rich-backed rendering.

Purpose
-------
Expose the Rich-based console adapter so application composition roots can bind
:class:`lib_log_rich.application.ports.console.ConsolePort` to the Rich
implementation documented in ``concept_architecture.md``.

Contents
--------
* :class:`RichConsoleAdapter` â€“ renders human-facing log lines with theme and
  colour overrides.

System Role
-----------
Acts as the adapter layer boundary for terminal output, making it explicit which
implementation satisfies the console port in the Clean Architecture stack.
