`pypsql` is a lightweight framework for connecting to PostgreSQL
databases, whether locally or remotely hosted. It builds on top of
[`SQLAlchemy`](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to provide a simple,
Pythonic interface for establishing connections, running queries, and
managing database sessions.

# Installation

``` bash
pip install pypsql
```

# Basic Usage

## Provide database credentials

You can store the database connection details in a file, for example:

``` python
SERVER=<host name or address>   # e.g., localhost, 127.0.0.1, or a public IP
PORT=<port number>              # default: 5432
NAME_DATABASE=<database name>   # e.g., my_db
NAME_USER=<role>                # e.g., Alice
PASSWORD_USER=<password>        # e.g., 123abc
```

You may place this file anywhere on the client machine. Importantly,
this step is optional. You can also provide the variables interactively
via terminal prompts.

## No SSH required

An SSH tunnel is not needed if:

- the server and client run on the same machine,
- the server and client are in the same (virtual) network, or
- the server is accessible via its public IP.

In this case, simply run the Python script:

``` python
import pypsql
from pathlib import Path

conn = pypsql.DatabaseConnector(
    path=Path(<path to the credential file>), # e.g., "/Users/marius/Desktop/" # if the .env file is located in the same directory as the script you are executing, you can leave this argument undefined
    db_credential_file=<name of credential file>   # e.g., ".env" (default) or "credentials.py"
)

sql_script = """
SELECT *
FROM customers
"""

df = conn.get_data(sql_script)

print(df)
```

Note that this example assumes the database contains a table named
`customers`.

## Connection via SSH
