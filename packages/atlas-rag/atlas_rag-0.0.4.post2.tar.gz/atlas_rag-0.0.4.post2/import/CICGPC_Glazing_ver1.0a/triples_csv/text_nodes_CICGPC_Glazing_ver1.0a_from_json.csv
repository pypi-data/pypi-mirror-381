This Assessment Standard (hereafter referred as the ""Standard"") sets out the assessment criteria and their benchmarks for glazing products to govern the application and award of a label under the Scheme. The Standard also defines the verification methods to determine which labelling grade should be awarded to the product according to the assessment criteria. This Standard neither modifies nor supersedes laws and regulations. Compliance with this Standard is not a substitute for, and does not assure, compliance with any applicable laws or regulations. Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations is a prerequisite for the manufacturing and marketing of the product. <span id=""page-5-2""></span> ## **1.2 BACKGROUND** Glazing products are commonly used [building material](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_material) for fixed and opening windows, window doors, curtain walls and other elements of the building envelop. The glazing area of a building could account for 10 to 25% of a building's exposed surface, serving as an interface to transmit light and provide outdoor view. Common types of glazing being used in architectural applications include clear and tinted float glass, tempered glass, and laminated glass as well as a variety of coated glasses, etc. Many of them contain substances that may be harmful to the environment and human health. However, the greatest environmental impact of glazing products is resulted from the energy losses during the building operation stage due to their long technical service life. The purposes of the assessment criteria developed for glazing are, therefore, to promote the use of energy-efficient building envelop, and to minimise the environmental impact through stringent assessment criteria on the production process and use of materials. ## <span id=""page-5-3""></span>**2. SCOPE** The scope of this Standard is applicable to glass in fixed and opening windows, window doors, and other elements of building envelop. Glass blocks and bricks or glass used for internal partitions are excluded from this Standard. *Note:* Each application should specify its types (single / double glazing etc.) and product series. **ONE** application is only for **ONE** product series with same type of glazing. Subsequent applications can be made for similar products with different thickness and/or coatings under a labelled product series, which is only eligible for applying within the validity period of the label. # <span id=""page-6-0""></span>**3.
