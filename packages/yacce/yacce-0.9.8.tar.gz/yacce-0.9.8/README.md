# Yacce is a *non-intrusive* compile_commands.json extractor for Bazel (experimental, local compilation, Linux only)

Yacce extracts `compile_commands.json` and build system insights from a build system by supervising
the local compilation process with `strace`. Yacce primarily supports Bazel (other build systems
might be added later).

## Motivation

Only open-source history of Bazel development spans for over a decade, and yet - it has a ton of C++
specific features, while one of very important ones, - generation of `compile_commands.json`, - is
still not there. There situation is so ridiculous that even G's own commands had to invent and
support their own "wheels" to make compile_commands for their projects (sample refs: [1](https://openxla.org/xla/lsp#how_do_i_generate_compile_commandsjson_for_xla_source_code),
[2](https://cs.opensource.google/pigweed/pigweed/+/master:pw_ide/py/pw_ide/compile_commands_generator.py)).

But there already exist several decent generic `compile_commands.json` extractors, external to Bazel,
with `hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor` being the most well-known and, probably, respected.
Why bother?

There are several reasons:
- their usability is horrible, - extractors I've seen (I don't claim I saw all
of them in existence!) requires one to make a certain nontrivial modification of the build system
and specifically list there what targets and how exactly are going to be compiled just to spew the
damn compile_commands!
    - what if I'm supporting a complex project spanning across multiple code bases, that don't employ
    such extractor, and I have to work on many code branches across many different remote machines?
    I'd have to first extract potentially branch specific build targets, and then manually inject
    extractor's code into the build system. Do this a few times a week, and you'll start to genuinely
    dislike Bazel (if you don't yet).
    - why it can't be made as simple as, for example, in CMake with its `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1` ?
- completely orthogonal to usability there is an InfoSec consideration: what if I don't want to add
a 3rd party, potentially compromisable dependency, into my project? I have no idea what it does
internally there and what could it inject into my binaries under the hood. Why does an extractor
have to be intrusive?

## Benefits of yacce

Supervising a build system doing compilation with a standard system tool have several great benefits:
- Yacce is super user-friendly and simple to use. It's basically a drop-in prefix for a shell command
you could use to build the project, be it `bazel build ...`, `bazel run ...`, or even
`MY_ENV_VAR="value" ./build/compile.sh arg1 .. argn`. Just prepend your build command with `yacce -- ` and hit enter.
- `strace` lets yacce see real compiler invocations, hence `compile_commands.json` made from strace
log reflects the way you build the project precisely, with all the custom configuration details
you might have used, and independently of what the build system lets you to know and not know about that.
- Compilation of all external dependencies as well as linking commands, are automatically included (with a
microsecond timing resolution, if needed).
- There are just no InfoSec risks by design (of course, beyond running a code of yacce itself,
though it's rather small and is easy to verify). Yacce is completely external to the build system and
doesn't interfere with it in any way.

## Limitations

However, the supervising approach have some intrinsic limitations, which make it not suitable
for all use-cases supported by Bazel:

- `strace` needs to be installed (`apt install strace`), which limits yacce to basically **Linux only**.
- **compilation could only happen locally**, on the very same machine, on which yacce runs. This
leaves out a Bazel RBE, and requires building the project from an empty cache, if the cache is used.
- while yacce doesn't care how you launch the build system and lets you use any script or a command
you like, eventually, it should **build only one Bazel workspace**. Yacce does not check if this
limitation is respected by a user, though typically, it's easy to fulfil.

If this is a hard no-go for you, ~~suffer with~~ consider other extractor, such as the above mentioned
[hedronvision's](https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor) tool.

There are some "soft" limitations that might be removed in the future, such as:
1. currently yacce does not support incremental builds (i.e. you'd have to fully recompile the
project to update `compile_commands.json`). The fix for that is simple and just a matter of implementation.
2. It looks like `strace` sometimes might produce...misformed logs. I always get what I expect on
Debian 12-13, but I had to implement a special handling for unexpected line-breaks it sometimes
produces on Ubuntu 22.04. I can't guarantee that there are no other quirks that could break log parsing.
3. Bazel is monstrous. While yacce works nicely with some code bases, there might be edge cases, that
aren't properly handled.
4. One can't just take all the compiler invocations a build system does and simply dump them to a
`compile_command.json`. A certain filtering is mandatory, and that requires parsing compiler's arguments:
    - gcc- and clang- compatible compilers are the only supported.
    - 100% correct compiler's argument parsing requires implementing 100% of compiler's own CLI
  parser, which is not done and will never be done. Yacce's parser is good enough for many uses, but
  certainly not for all. Yacce could diagnose some edge cases and warn of potentially
  incorrect results, but, again, - certainly not all edge cases are covered by the diagnostics.

You're unlikely to hit the last two. However, if you will, you know what to do (please file a bug report, or better submit a PR).

Give yacce a try with `pip install yacce`! Prepend the build command with `yacce -- ` and let me know how it goes!

## Example

*An elaborate way to say "just prepend your build script with `yacce -- `"*

First, install yacce with `pip install yacce`. Python 3.10+ is supported.

Second, ensure you have [strace](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html) installed with
`sudo apt install strace`. Some distributions have it installed by default.

JAX is one of Google's machine learning frameworks. Part of it is written in Python, while high
performance code is in C++. A compiled part is called `jaxlib` and is responsible for parts of JAX
common for all execution backends, and for a CPU-based backend. We'll be using currently the latest
JAX v0.7.2 here.

Compiling jaxlib is a good first example for yacce, because it has quite a sizeable code base with
at least one dependency, XLA (a machine learning compiler), that is almost always being worked upon
in parallel with the jaxlib itself. By default, JAX's build system fetches XLA from a
[pinned commit](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/jax-v0.7.2/third_party/xla/revision.bzl#L24), but
since we emulate a real developer work here, we'll also checkout that pinned commit to a local directory,
so we could work on it, and then tell JAX's build system to use that local directory instead of the
pinned commit. Yacce will automatically generate a single `compile_commands.json` for both jaxlib
and XLA.

First, let's setup the workspace:
```bash
mkdir /src_jax && cd /src_jax  # the dir for both JAX and XLA sources
( git clone https://github.com/openxla/xla && cd ./xla \
  && git checkout 0fccb8a6037019b20af2e502ba4b8f5e0f98c8f6 )
git clone --branch jax-v0.7.2 --depth 1 https://github.com/jax-ml/jax
```
Now we have `/src_jax/jax` directory having v0.7.2 JAX commit checkout, and `/src_jax/xla` having
the same XLA commit, that's designed for JAX v0.7.2. Time to build!

Without yacce, I'd use the following command inside the `./jax` directory:
```bash
python3 ./build/build.py build --wheels=jaxlib --verbose --use_clang false \
  --target_cpu_features=native --bazel_options=--override_repository=xla=../xla
```

With yacce, it's just prepending the command with `yacce -- ` like this:

```bash
cd ./jax  # since we didn't change the dir yet
yacce -- python3 ./build/build.py build --wheels=jaxlib --verbose --use_clang false \
  --target_cpu_features=native --bazel_options=--override_repository=xla=../xla
```

At the start, yacce will test if strace and bazel are available, and then it will ask your permission to
execute `bazel clean` command. Starting with a clean state is mandatory for yacce to capture all
compilation commands, but since cleaning and rebuilding from scratch might be expensive, yacce tries
to prevent accidental harm by asking a permission. You can authorize it to do that from command line
with `--clean always` argument put before `--` separator like this: `yacce --clean always -- `.

After doing `bazel clean`, yacce will setup `strace` supervision over Bazel's server execution, and
then launch the build script. When the build finishes, yacce will start strace log processing
and in few seconds it'll write `/src_jax/jax/compile_command.json` containing all C++ source files
used for `jaxlib` and for parts of XLA, that were required by jaxlib.

> [!TIP]
> If a build system fails or cancelled manually (such as by hitting Ctrl+C), by default yacce will
> still try to process the gathered strace log and produce at least something. You can use that to
> you advantage by running scripts invoking other bazel commands, such as `bazel run` or
> `bazel test` under yacce. Just be aware that not all programs are friendly to strace.
> For example, address sanitizer can't work under strace, so all tests compiled with the sanitizer
> will fail under yacce/strace.

Now fire up your IDE and point `clangd` to that file, so it starts indexing it. In VSCode with `clangd`
extension installed, if `/src_jax` is the main opened directory (workspace), then one could open
Settings / Extensions / clangd, and click "Add Item" for `clangd.arguments` settings, putting
`--compile-commands-dir=${workspaceFolder}/jax` there and then do ctrl+shift+p, "clangd.restart".

## Modes of yacce operation and how to configure them

Yacce currently have at least 2 main modes of operation and few submodes, and have a pretty
extensive configurability. Just run `yacce --help` to see the details. Below is a typical output you
can expect, but please note this could be obsolete. Please always query yacce for the actual features
and settings it supports.

### Main options

```
$ yacce -h
usage: yacce [-h] [--debug {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}] [--colors | --no-colors] {bazel,from_log} ...

Yacce extracts compile_commands.json and build system insights from a build system by supervising
the local compilation process with strace.
Primarily supports Bazel (other build systems might be added later).
--> Homepage: https://github.com/Arech/yacce

positional arguments:
{bazel,from_log}      Modes of operation. Use "--help" with each mode to get more information.
bazel                 Runs a given build system based on Bazel in a shell and extracts
                      compile_commands.json from it (possibly with individual
                      compile_commands.json for each external dependency).
                      This is a default mode activated if the mode specification is just
                      omitted.
                      Hint: use 'yacce bazel --help' to get CLI arguments help.
from_log              [dbg!] Generates a possibly NON-WORKING(!) compile_commands.json from a
                      strace log file.
                      This mode features the most generic way to parse strace output and since
                      the log generally lacks some important information (such as the working
                      directory in case of a Bazel), it may produce a non-working
                      compile_commands.json. The mode is primarily intended for debugging
                      purposes as it doesn't use any knowledge about the build system used and
                      just parses the strace log file and turns it into compile_commands.json as
                      is.
                      Hint: use 'yacce from_log --help' to get CLI arguments help.

options:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
--debug {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
                      Minimum debug level to show. 0 is the most verbose.
                      Default level is (info=) 2. Setting it higher than a (warning=) 3 is not
                      recommended.
--colors, --no-colors
                      Controls if the output could be colored. (default: True)
```

### Options for Bazel mode

```
$ yacce bazel -h

usage: yacce [global options] [bazel] [options (see below)] [-- shell command eventually invoking Bazel]

Yacce extracts compile_commands.json and build system insights from a build system by supervising
the local compilation process with strace.
Primarily supports Bazel (other build systems might be added later).
--> Homepage: https://github.com/Arech/yacce

Mode 'bazel' is intended to generate compile_commands.json from tracing execution of a 'bazel
build' or any other shell command invoking Bazel using the Linux's strace utility. Hence it only
supports compilation of a single Bazel workspace (including its all external dependencies)
happening locally. If you are using Bazel's remote caching feature, including '--disk_cache',
please make sure you're starting with a clean cache, otherwise yacce won't see compilation of
cache hits.

options:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
--log_file path/to/file
                      Write strace log to and/or read it from this file.
                      See also '--from_log'.
                      Default: 'strace.txt' in the current directory
--external {ignore,combine-with-overridden,to-files,to-external,combine-all}
                      Determines what to do when a compilation of a project's dependency source
                      file (from 'external/' subdirectory) is found.
                      - One option is to just to 'ignore' (remove) it and to leave in the
                      resulting compile_commands.json *only* commands directly related to the
                      project.
                      - The default option 'combine-with-overridden' produces a single
                      compile_commands.json containing main project's files as well as
                      dependencies that are stored *outside* of their expected location at
                      '$(bazel info output_base)/external/<repo>' (this typically happens when
                      you override a dependency repo location for Bazel when you work on the
                      project and its dependency simultaneously).
                      - Option 'to-files' produces individual files nearby the main
                      compile_commands.json, named like'compile_commands_ext_<repo>.json' for
                      each external dependency '<repo>' (this might be useful for manual
                      inspection).
                      - Option 'to-external' differs from 'to-files' only in the location and
                      naming of the resulting files. 'to-external' produces an individual
                      compile_commands.json in each external dependency's directory and is
                      useful when you're going to open the dependency directory in a parallel
                      IDE for a close inspection.
                      - The 'combine-all' option just writes all compilation commands (for the
                      main project and its dependencies) into a single file.
                      See '--dest_dir' argument for a default location and/or override for the
                      main project's compile_commands.json file.
                      NOTE that since currently yacce doesn't properly process compiler
                      invocations that aren't related to compiling C or C++ sources (such as
                      linking only, or compiling ASM files), if '--other_commands' flag is
                      specified, a compound other_commands.json (containing all other
                      invocations of a compiler for the main project and its externals) will be
                      saved nearby the main compile_commands.json irrespective of a value of
                      this flag.
--bazel_command command_or_filepath
                      Override which command to run to communicate with the instance of a Bazel
                      for the build system.
                      You don't typically need this argument, if you have bazelisk installed.
                      To set the workspace directory see '--bazel_workspace' argument.
                      Default: bazel
--bazel_workspace path/to/dir
                      Overrides Bazel workspace directory to set a current directory context for
                      the bazel command (see '--bazel_command').
                      This is useful if yacce needs to be run from an outside of that workspace.
                      Note that any dir under a real workspace would also work here.
                      Default: a current working directory
--build_cwd path/to/dir
                      By default, a shell command to start the build is invoked from the Bazel
                      workspace directory (see '--bazel_workspace'). This argument allows to
                      override that and set a different directory as a cwd for the build
                      command.
                      Note that this is different from '--cwd' argument, which for the 'bazel
                      --from_log' mode of yacce specifies a value of '$(bazel info
                      execution_root)' directory.
--build_shell shell_to_use
                      Build command is executed by passing it to a shell. By default, 'bash' is
                      used, but you can override that with this argument.
--ensure_build_succeeds, --no-ensure_build_succeeds
                      By default yacce only warns if the build command fails (exits with a non-
                      zero code) and it tries to process the strace log file to produce some
                      results anyway. If you want to make sure that yacce will only use a full
                      log of a successful build, set this argument to enforce yacce failure if
                      the build fails.
                      (default: False)
--cwd path/to/dir     Path to the working directory of the compilation.
                      This value goes to a 'directory' field of an entry of
                      compile_commands.json and is used to resolve relative paths found in the
                      command. If '--ignore-not-found' argument isn't set, yacce will try to
                      test if mentioned files exist in this directory and warn if they aren't.
                      Note that passing the file existence test helps, but doesn't guarantee
                      that the resulting compile_commands.json will be correct.
                      In the 'yacce bazel --from_log' mode, this argument overrides an output of
                      '$(bazel info execution_root)' (i.e. this enables parsing of an existing
                      log file without querying its build system). In the default live mode
                      (when no '--from_log' argument is specified) this argument is either has
                      to be unset, or match the output of '$(bazel info execution_root)'.
--ignore-not-found, --no-ignore-not-found
                      If set, will not test if files to be added to .json exists.
                      (default: False)
-o, --other_commands, --no-other_commands
                      If set, yacce will also generate other_commands.json file.
                      This file has a similar to compile_commands.json format, but contains all
                      other compiler invocations found that aren't useful for gathering C++
                      symbol information of the project, but handy to get insights about the
                      build in general (such as for compiling assembler sources or for linking).
                      Note that yacce currently does not implement attribution of other
                      compilation commands to the project's external dependencies. I.e. all
                      other commands related to compiling non-C++ sources and linking will be
                      combined into a single other_commands.json file irrespective of '--
                      external' argument setting. (default: False)
--save_duration, --no-save_duration
                      If set, yacce will add a 'duration_s' field into the resulting .json that
                      contain how long the command run in seconds with a microsecond resolution.
                      This feature currently doesn't have automated use, but the file can be
                      inspected manually, or with a custom script to obtain build system
                      performance insights.

                      (default: False)
--save_line_num, --no-save_line_num
                      If set, yacce will add a 'line_num' integer field into the resulting .json
                      that contain a line number of the compiler call in the strace log file.
                      Useful for debugging, but have no automated use.

--discard_outputs_with_pfx [path/prefix ...]
                      A build system can compile some dummy source files only to gather
                      information about compiler capabilities. Presence of these files in the
                      compile_commands.json aren't usually helpful. Typically, such files are
                      placed into /tmp or /dev/null, but other variants are possible.
                      This setting allows to fully customize which prefixes of a compiler's
                      output file should lead to ignoring the compilation call.

                      Similar to --discard_outputs_with_pfx, but controls which prefixes of
                      source files should lead to ignoring the compiler call.
                      Pass an empty string "" to disable. Accepts multiple values at once.
                      Default: [''].
--discard_args_with_pfx [+compiler_arg_prefix ...]
                      Certain compiler arguments, such as sanitizers, are known to choke clangd.
                      Some others like those concerning build reproducibility might be useless
                      for C++ symbols.
                      Set a value of this parameter to a sequence of prefixes to match and
                      remove such compiler arguments.
                      Pass an empty string "" to disable. Accepts multiple values at once.
                      ATTENTION: since Python's argparse always treats a leading dash in a CLI
                      argument as a script's argument name, but not value, use a plus sign '+'
                      instead of a dash '-' to specify a leading dash. Example: instead of
                      '-fsanitize' use '+fsanitize'.
                      Default: ['+fsanitize'].
--discard_args [+compiler_arg_or_args_pair_spec ...]
                      Similarly to '--discard_args_with_pfx', values for this argument define a
                      set of compiler arguments (such as '-DMY_DEF=VALUE') or pipe-delimited
                      argument pairs (like a single token value '-I|/certain/dir' defines a two
                      token pair '-I /certain/dir') that will be removed from a compiler
                      invocation.
                      Note that a single token specification of a '-D' compiler argument has a
                      special handling and also addresses its two token alternatives.
                      Pass an empty string "" to disable. Accepts multiple values at once.
                      ATTENTION: since Python's argparse always treats a leading dash in a CLI
                      argument as a script's argument name, but not value, use a plus sign '+'
                      instead of a dash '-' to specify a leading dash. For the above it's
                      '+DMY_DEF=VALUE' and '+I|/certain/dir'.
                      Default: ['+DADDRESS_SANITIZER'].
--enable_dupes_check, --no-enable_dupes_check
                      If set, yacce will report if a pair <source, output> isn't unique.
                      Usefulness of this flag solely depends on actual build system
                      implementation. Some might use lots of temporary compilations just to
                      gather compiler capabilities which could lead to an avalanche of false
                      positives. This could be mitigated with --discard* family of flags, but
                      this requires manual intervention, hence it's disabled by default.
                      (default: False)
-c [compiler_basename_or_path_fragment ...], --compiler [compiler_basename_or_path_fragment ...]
                      Adds an absolute path, a basename, a path suffix, or a path prefix
                      (prepend it with a plus '+' symbol) of a custom compiler to the set of
                      compilers already detectable by yacce. Accepts multiple values at once.
                      --not_compiler [compiler_basename_or_path_fragment ...]
                      You can prevent a certain absolute path, a basename, a path suffix, or a
                      path prefix (prepend it with a plus '+' symbol) from being treated as a
                      compiler by using this argument. Accepts multiple values at once.
--enable_compiler_scripts, --no-enable_compiler_scripts
                      By default, yacce doesn't treat a script (classified by a shebang #! in
                      the first 2 bytes of the file) invocation as a compiler invocation and
                      ignores it. Set this option when this behavior is unwanted.
                      (default: False)
-d dir/path, --dest_dir dir/path
                      Destination directory in which yacce should create resulting .json files.
                      Must exist.
                      Default: directory of the log file (see '--log_file')

Log mode, uses existing strace log and is mutually exclusive with the live mode:
--from_log            Toggles a mode in which yacce will only parse an existing log file
                      specified by '--log_file', but will not invoke a build system to spy on.
                      Mutually exclusive with '--keep_log' and requires no build system
                      arguments passed (no '--' argument and anything after it).
                      Default: not set, i.e. the mode is not activated.

Live mode (default), runs a Bazel build system and is mutually exclusive with the log mode:
--keep_log {if_errors,always,never}
                      Determines conditions of keeping of the strace log file after yacce
                      finishes. Mutually exclusive with '--from_log'.
                      Default is 'always' as it might be useful to run yacce in the log mode
                      with different arguments later on the same log file.
--clean {always,expunge,never}
                      Determines, if a 'bazel clean' or 'bazel clean --expunge' commands should
                      be executed before running the build.
                      Note that if cleaning is disabled, cached (already compiled) sources will
                      be invisible to yacce and hence will not make it into resulting
                      compiler_commands.json! (iterative updates aren't supported yet)
                      Default: not specified, yacce will ask if running 'bazel clean' is ok.

Yacce extracts compile_commands.json and build system insights from a build system by supervising
the local compilation process with strace.
Primarily supports Bazel (other build systems might be added later).
--> Homepage: https://github.com/Arech/yacce

Mode 'from_log' is a supplementary mode that generates a compile_commands.json from a strace log
file without using any additional information about build system.
ATTENTION: this mode is intended for debugging purposes only and most likely will not produce a
correct compile_commands.json due to a lack of information about the build process details.
If you want to regenerate compile_commands from a log file for Bazel, use 'yacce bazel --from_log'
instead.

positional arguments:
  log_file              Path to the strace log file to parse.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --cwd path/to/dir     Path to the working directory of the compilation.
                        This value goes to a 'directory' field of an entry of
                        compile_commands.json and is used to resolve relative paths found in the
                        command. If '--ignore-not-found' argument isn't set, yacce will try to
                        test if mentioned files exist in this directory and warn if they aren't.
                        Note that passing the file existence test helps, but doesn't guarantee
                        that the resulting compile_commands.json will be correct.
                        In the 'from_log' mode a relative path specification is resolved to the
                        absolute path using a directory of the log file.
                        Default: directory of the log file.
  --ignore-not-found, --no-ignore-not-found
                        If set, will not test if files to be added to .json exists.
                        (default: False)
  -o, --other_commands, --no-other_commands
                        If set, yacce will also generate other_commands.json file.
                        This file has a similar to compile_commands.json format, but contains all
                        other compiler invocations found that aren't useful for gathering C++
                        symbol information of the project, but handy to get insights about the
                        build in general (such as for compiling assembler sources or for linking).
                        (default: False)
  --save_duration, --no-save_duration
                        If set, yacce will add a 'duration_s' field into the resulting .json that
                        contain how long the command run in seconds with a microsecond resolution.
                        This feature currently doesn't have automated use, but the file can be
                        inspected manually, or with a custom script to obtain build system
                        performance insights.
                        WARNING: current clangd gets upset when it finds a field it doesn't know,
                        so enabling this option might prevent you from using clangd with the
                        resulting file!
                        (default: False)
  --save_line_num, --no-save_line_num
                        If set, yacce will add a 'line_num' integer field into the resulting .json
                        that contain a line number of the compiler call in the strace log file.
                        Useful for debugging, but have no automated use.

  --discard_outputs_with_pfx [path/prefix ...]
                        A build system can compile some dummy source files only to gather
                        information about compiler capabilities. Presence of these files in the
                        compile_commands.json aren't usually helpful. Typically, such files are
                        placed into /tmp or /dev/null, but other variants are possible.
                        This setting allows to fully customize which prefixes of a compiler's
                        output file should lead to ignoring the compilation call.
                        Pass an empty string "" to disable. Accepts multiple values at once.
                        Default: ['/dev/null', '/tmp/'].
  --discard_sources_with_pfx [path/prefix ...]
                        Similar to --discard_outputs_with_pfx, but controls which prefixes of
                        source files should lead to ignoring the compiler call.
                        Pass an empty string "" to disable. Accepts multiple values at once.
                        Default: [''].
  --discard_args_with_pfx [+compiler_arg_prefix ...]
                        Certain compiler arguments, such as sanitizers, are known to choke clangd.
                        Some others like those concerning build reproducibility might be useless
                        for C++ symbols.
                        Set a value of this parameter to a sequence of prefixes to match and
                        remove such compiler arguments.
                        Pass an empty string "" to disable. Accepts multiple values at once.
                        ATTENTION: since Python's argparse always treats a leading dash in a CLI
                        argument as a script's argument name, but not value, use a plus sign '+'
                        instead of a dash '-' to specify a leading dash. Example: instead of
                        '-fsanitize' use '+fsanitize'.
                        Default: ['+fsanitize'].
  --discard_args [+compiler_arg_or_args_pair_spec ...]
                        Similarly to '--discard_args_with_pfx', values for this argument define a
                        set of compiler arguments (such as '-DMY_DEF=VALUE') or pipe-delimited
                        argument pairs (like a single token value '-I|/certain/dir' defines a two
                        token pair '-I /certain/dir') that will be removed from a compiler
                        invocation.
                        Note that a single token specification of a '-D' compiler argument has a
                        special handling and also addresses its two token alternatives.

                        instead of a dash '-' to specify a leading dash. For the above it's
                        '+DMY_DEF=VALUE' and '+I|/certain/dir'.
                        Default: ['+DADDRESS_SANITIZER'].
  --enable_dupes_check, --no-enable_dupes_check
                        If set, yacce will report if a pair <source, output> isn't unique.

                        this requires manual intervention, hence it's disabled by default.
                        (default: False)
  -c [compiler_basename_or_path_fragment ...], --compiler [compiler_basename_or_path_fragment ...]
                        Adds an absolute path, a basename, a path suffix, or a path prefix
                        (prepend it with a plus '+' symbol) of a custom compiler to the set of
                        compilers already detectable by yacce. Accepts multiple values at once.
  --not_compiler [compiler_basename_or_path_fragment ...]
                        You can prevent a certain absolute path, a basename, a path suffix, or a
                        path prefix (prepend it with a plus '+' symbol) from being treated as a
                        compiler by using this argument. Accepts multiple values at once.
  --enable_compiler_scripts, --no-enable_compiler_scripts
                        By default, yacce doesn't treat a script (classified by a shebang #! in
                        the first 2 bytes of the file) invocation as a compiler invocation and
                        ignores it. Set this option when this behavior is unwanted.
                        (default: False)
