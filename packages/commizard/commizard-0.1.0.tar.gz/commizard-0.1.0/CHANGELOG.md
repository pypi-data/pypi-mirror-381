## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2025/10/01

### Added

- `cp` command to copy the generated message to the clipboard.
- `commit` command to directly commit the generated message without editing.

- Added CHANGELOG.md to track notable changes.

### Changed

- Improved and updated `README.md`.

- Added dynamic versioning: the project version is now centralized in
  `__init__.py`.
- Improved the diff sent to the LLM, allowing for more accurate commits with
  fewer tokens.

  progress, but the programâ€™s flow is now cleaner and more maintainable.

### Fixed

- Fixed `gen` command crashing when user changes contained certain special
  Unicode characters. Changes containing any UTF-8 supported character are now
