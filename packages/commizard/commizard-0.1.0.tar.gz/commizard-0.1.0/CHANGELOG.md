## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2025/10/01

### Added

- `cp` command to copy the generated message to the clipboard.
- `commit` command to directly commit the generated message without editing.
- A unit test suite (currently 140 tests implemented, with 8 still failing).
- Argument parsing: `-h`, `--help`, `-v`, and `--version` are now supported.
- Added CHANGELOG.md to track notable changes.

### Changed

- Improved and updated `README.md`.
- Moved TODO items to GitHub issues.
- Added dynamic versioning: the project version is now centralized in
  `__init__.py`.
- Improved the diff sent to the LLM, allowing for more accurate commits with
  fewer tokens.
- Refactored significant parts of the codebase. This is still a work in
  progress, but the program’s flow is now cleaner and more maintainable.

### Fixed

- Fixed `gen` command crashing when user changes contained certain special
  Unicode characters. Changes containing any UTF-8 supported character are now
  handled correctly.
