"""
The inventory keeps track of all directories used.

It ensures that no two file fields use the same directory unless they share the same view
for these files as well. Furthermore, different models are also prohibited from using the
same directory. Note that only the upload_to paths are evaluated for this purpose.

The inventory can find the associated view for any file, provided that a view has been
registered or generated with the file field. This is sometimes used by ProtectedStorage to
get URLs for its FieldFiles.

Furthermore, the inventory keeps record of all paths used.

To register new directories or access inventory information, use the methods provided
in this module.
