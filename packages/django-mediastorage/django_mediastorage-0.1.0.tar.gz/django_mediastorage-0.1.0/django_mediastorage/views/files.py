class BaseFileView(View):
    """
    A view that returns files, using django_mediastorage.response.build_file_response.

    This class is not intended to be used directly. The four class attributes must be
    adjusted to the use case.

    By default, this class' `get` method expects to be passed a `path` from the URL
    matcher. It will prepend UPLOAD_TO to that path for further handling. For more complex
    handling, override the `_get_path_from_kwargs` method.

    When used together with a ProtectedFileField, UPLOAD_TO should be the same as
    upload_to of the field, and DOCUMENT_ROOT should be the DOCUMENT_ROOT of the file
    storage.

    PROTECTED_URLPATHROOT should point to a URL that is equivalent to the DOCUMENT_ROOT
    for use with X-Accel-Redirect (similar to build_file_response).

    This view will only serve files inside its UPLOAD_TO directory.

    You can use path_kwargs() to get the view and name to pass to a urls.py entry.

    If you need the path "name" to be predictable, override the REVERSE_PATH_NAME
    attribute.

    If you need ProtectedFileField.url to be working, setting the `REVERSE_PATH_NAME` to
    a corresponding url path name in urls.py should be enough. If you have overridden
    _get_path_from_kwargs(), you will need to implement a reversal for that by also
    overriding _get_kwargs_from_path(). If this isn't enough, you could also override
    `get_url()` otherwise.

    Attributes

    IS_GENERATED:
        needed by generator.generate_view_class to mark generated views as generated
    DOCUMENT_ROOT:
        Should be the document root of the associated field's storage.
    UPLOAD_TO:
        Path that all files of this view are inside of. Essentially the same as FileField
        upload_to. See build_file_response() for more details.
    REVERSE_PATH_NAME:
        Reverse path that can be used in django's "reverse" function to point to this
        view.
    PROTECTED_URLPATHROOT:
        URL Prefix that points to the same directory as DOCUMENT_ROOT. See
