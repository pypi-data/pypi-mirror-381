# This script builds a Python package index on gitlab.dune-project.org. Such an
# index is necessary as a drop-in replacement for PyPI in continuous integration,
# when runners operate with restricted network access.
#
# Running this script requires the following prerequisites to be met:
# * Go to Gitlab Profile/Setting/Access Tokens and create a personal API access token with
#   at least the `write_registry` and 'api' scope.
# * Export your token with `export TWINE_PASSWORD=<token>`
#

# This script exits upon errors
set -e

# We authenticate with a personal Gitlab API token. You are expected to
# have set TWINE_PASSWORD to your API token when calling this script.
export TWINE_USERNAME=__token__

# Make sure that TWINE_PASSWORD was set
# export TWINE_PASSWORD=...
