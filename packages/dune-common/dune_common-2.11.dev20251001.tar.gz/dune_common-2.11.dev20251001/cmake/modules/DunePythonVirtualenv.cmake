# Manage the creation of a configure-time virtual environment
#
# .. cmake_module::
#
#    This module manages the creation of virtual python environment during
#    configuration. The purpose of this virtual environment is to be able to run
#    python code from cmake in situations such as python-based code generation,
#    running postprocessing in python during testing etc.
#    If enabled the Python bindings are also installed (editable) into the
#    internal virtual environment.
#
#    The internal virtual environment is only generated if the
#    configuration is not run with an active virtual environment. If an
#    external environment is detected this will be used instead of the
#    internal environment.
#
#    Although designed for internal use, the internal (or detected external)
#    virtualenv can also be manually inspected. A symlink to the activation script is
#    placed in the top level build directory of all Dune modules in the stack.
#    To directly execute a command in the virtualenv, you can use the script
#    :code:`run-in-dune-env <command>`, which is also placed into every build directory.
#
#    All packages installed with :ref:`dune_python_configure_bindings` or
#    :ref:`dune_python_configure_package` are automatically installed into the virtualenv.
#
#    After execution of this module, the following are available for use in
#    downstream modules:
#
#    * :code:`DUNE_PYTHON_VIRTUALENV_PATH` The path of the virtual environment
#    * :code:`DUNE_PYTHON_VIRTUALENV_EXECUTABLE` The python interpreter in the virtual environment
#
#    By default, the created virtualenv resides in the first non-installed Dune module of
#    the module stack (if no installation is performed: dune-common). Be aware
#    that mixing installed and non-installed modules may result in a situation,
#    where multiple such environments are created, although only one should.
#    You can change this behavior by either specifying a fixed path for the virtualenv
#    using :ref:`DUNE_PYTHON_VIRTUALENV_PATH` or by enabling
#    :ref:`DUNE_PYTHON_EXTERNAL_VIRTUALENV_FOR_ABSOLUTE_BUILDDIR` if you are using an
#    absolute build directory with dunecontrol. Note that this flag is enabled by default
#    starting from Dune 2.7.
#
# .. cmake_variable:: DUNE_PYTHON_VIRTUALENV_PATH
#
#    When the Dune build system has setup a virtualenv, this variable will contain its location.
#    You can also set this variable to a fixed path when calling CMake, and the virtualenv will
#    be placed at that location.
#
# .. cmake_variable:: DUNE_PYTHON_EXTERNAL_VIRTUALENV_FOR_ABSOLUTE_BUILDDIR
#
#    Before Dune 2.7, the virtualenv was always placed inside the build directory of  the first
#    non-installed Dune module that the current module depends on. When using installed core modules
#    or a multi-stage installation process, this can lead to situations where there are multiple
#    virtualenvs, making it impossible to find all Python modules installed by upstream modules.
#    In order to avoid this problem at least for builds using an absolute build directory (i.e., the
#    :code:`--builddir` option of dunecontrol refers to an absolute path), the build system will
#    place the virtualenv in a dedicated directory :code:`dune-python-env` inside that absolute
#    build directory, where it will be found by all Dune modules. If you want to disable this
#    behavior, set :code:`DUNE_PYTHON_EXTERNAL_VIRTUALENV_FOR_ABSOLUTE_BUILDDIR=0`.
#
# .. cmake_variable:: DUNE_PYTHON_ALLOW_GET_PIP
#
#    The Dune build system will try to build a virtualenv with pip installed into it,
#    but this can fail in some situations, in particular on Debian and Ubuntu distributions.
#    In this case, you will see a warning message in the CMake output. If you are on Debian
#    or Ubuntu, try installing the :code:`python3-venv` (for Python 3) and / or
#    :code:`python-virtualenv` packages, delete your build directory and try configuring
#    again.
#
#    If that still does not help, set this variable to allow the Dune build system to download
#    :code:`get-pip.py` from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py at configure time and execute
#    it to install pip into the freshly set up virtual environment. While this should normally
#    not be necessary anymore, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/debian/+source/python3.4/+bug/1290847
#    for more information about the underlying distribution bug.
#
# .. cmake_variable:: DUNE_PYTHON_WHEELHOUSE
#
#    The place where python wheels are stored. Notice that this wheelhouse directory shall be
#    the same for all dune installations.
#
