/* This file determines the order how things appear in the doxygen
   documentation within the dune-common module. It works like this:

   @defgroup commands appear only in this file here which is
   parsed before the other files (because it is mentioned first
   in the Doxyfile).

   Only @addtogroup is used in the code documentation.
