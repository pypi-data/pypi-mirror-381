def load(functionName, includes, *args, pythonName=None):
    '''Just in time compile an algorithm.

    Generates binding for a single (template) function. The name of the
    function and the C++ types of the arguments passed to this function are
    used to generate a static type used in the bindings. The file(s)
    containing the code for the function are passed in either as single
    string or as a list of strings. Note that these files will be copied
    into the generated module. The file name can include a path name. So in
    the simples case `includes="header.hh" will include the file from the
    current working directory. To include a file from the directory
    containing the calling script use
    `includes=dune.generator.path(__file__)+"header.hh"`.

    The generated file will be compiled within the `dune-py` module and
    thus all include search paths and libraries are added to the command
    line. Currently we do not provide a direct way to add additional
    external packages not found during the build of the Dune modules. A way
    around this is to set the `CPATH` and `LIBRARY_PATH` environment
    variables before calling this function.

    Examples
    --------

      Assume that you want to use some `Eigen` linear algebra and would like
      to pass a `numpy` array to a function taking an `Eigen::VectorXd`. By
      default a `numpy` array will be export to C++ using `pybind11::array`
      although `pybind11` can also export this as `Eigen::VectorXd`.
      In addition `Dune` might not have been configured to find `Eigen` if
      it not in a default position in the system. In this case the
      following code will work
      ```
      code="""
      #include <dune/python/pybind11/eigen.h>
      auto test(ColVec_t& x_1) {...}
      """

      os.environ["CPATH"] = "PathToEigen"
      testAlgo = dune.generator.algorithm.load('test', io.StringIO(code),
                      dune.generator.algorithm.CPPType("Eigen::VectorXd") )

      ```

    Args:
        functionName:    name of the C++ function to provide bindings for
        includes:        single or list of files to add to the generated module
        *args:           list of arguments that will be passed to the generated module.
                         Entries here can be instances of standard Python types,
                         other Dune objects, or instances of the special class
                         `algorithm.CPPType` which is constructed by
                         providing a string with the required C++ type and
                         optionally a list of include files to add at the
                         top of the generated file.

                         Note: the type of the object passed to C++ must be
                               exportable.

                         signature is used.
