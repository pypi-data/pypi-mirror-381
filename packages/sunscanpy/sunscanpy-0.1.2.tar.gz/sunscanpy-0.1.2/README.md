  <p><em>A python library to calibrate the pointing of your weather or cloud radar based on the position of the Sun!</em></p>
</div>

## Description

Precise knowledge of the pointing direction is essential for weather and cloud radars. Radars with scanning capability can be calibrated using the sun as a microwave emitting target with a precisely defined position in the sky.
SunscanPy provides tools to evaluate radar measurements of the sun, derive the mispointing of your antenna and actively correct misalignments using the scanner motors.

For more information, see the two tutorial jupyter notebooks provided in the examples subfolder.
