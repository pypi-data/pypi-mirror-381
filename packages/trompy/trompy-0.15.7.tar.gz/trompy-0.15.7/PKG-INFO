# trompy

A collection of tools for plotting and data analysis from McCutcheon Lab based at UiT in Troms√∏, Norway (hence *trom-py*). We study ingestive behavior and motivation in rodent neuroscience experiments but code may be useful in other settings.
 
Highlights include:
 - ~~GUI for analyzing lick patterns in rodent feeding and drinking experiments~~ [^1]
 - ~~GUI for analyzing fiber photometry data from rodent neuroscience experiments~~
 - Function for plotting bar plots with individual data points
 - Function for reading data files produced by Med Associates behavioral equipment
 - Functions for analyzing patterns of licking in rodent experiments
 - Functions for performing ROC (receiver-operator characteristic) analysis
 
 [^1]: GUIs are now available as separate packages: https://github.com/mccutcheonlab/Lick-Calc-GUI and https://github.com/mccutcheonlab/photogui
 
Code is maintained by James McCutcheon, Dept of Psychology, UiT The Arctic University of Norway.
