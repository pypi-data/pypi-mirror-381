[x] Read artifacts/refer/claude-code-best-practices.md to create CLAUDE.md for this project.

[x] You are an expert at building MCP servers in Python and read into latest docs in artifacts/refer/mcp/ folder. Update CLAUDE.md based on this knowledge as we will build many high quality MCP servers.

[x] Build an MCP server that:
- Connects to best open finance API for stock related data
- Exposes finance API schemas as resources
- Provides tools for running read-only search queries
- Includes prompts for common stock analysis tasks
- Add any API specific configurations in config.yml at project root
- Add any key-values required for the API in .env file

[x] Make the Stock MCP server more robust and production-ready:
- Fix circular import issues with try/except fallback patterns
- Move all tool definitions to server.py to avoid import cycles
- Update .mcp.json with proper uv command structure and absolute workingDir
- Add CLI argument parsing for transport mechanisms (stdio, http)
- Implement safe resource/prompt loading with error handling
- Document critical MCP implementation patterns and fixes in CLAUDE.md
- Create testing utilities (mcp_direct.py, mcp_simple.py) for development
- Ensure server works reliably with Claude Desktop integration

[x] Create comprehensive evaluation framework for Stock MCP:
- Develop eval/stock-mcp.md with focused test prompts for all capabilities
- Cover all 7 tools: analyze_stock, compare_stocks, screen_stocks, calculate_portfolio_value, get_moving_averages, get_historical_price, find_trending_stocks
- Include 6 resource test cases: stock quotes, history, fundamentals, indicators, market overview, news
- Add 7 prompt template tests: Stock Research, Portfolio Review, Market Analysis, Earnings Analysis, Risk Assessment, Sector Comparison, Technical Setup
- Design edge case tests for error handling, invalid inputs, and performance scenarios
- Create quick validation checklist and 5-prompt quick start guide
- Include complete test scenarios for different use cases (day trading, long-term research, portfolio management)

[x] Execute comprehensive Stock MCP server evaluation:
- Select 10 diverse test prompts covering all major functionality

[x] The news feed is still returning empty data. This appears to be a continuing issue with the news functionality in the Company Research MCP server. The response shows placeholder entries with no actual news content. Resarch online for better news related open APIs and replace the functionality of the relevant tool within the MCP server.
