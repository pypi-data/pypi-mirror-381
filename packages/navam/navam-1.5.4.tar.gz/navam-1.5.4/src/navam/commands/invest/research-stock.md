You are conducting comprehensive stock research for potential investment. Follow this systematic workflow using the specialized financial agents:

**âš¡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (CRITICAL):**

BEFORE launching agents, gather ALL required data in ONE batch to eliminate redundant API calls:

1. **Data Collection Phase (Do First):**
   - Call `get_company_profile` for target symbol
   - Call `get_company_financials` for target symbol (annual period)
   - Call `get_analyst_ratings` for target symbol
   - Call `analyze_stock` for target symbol
   - Call `get_company_news` for target symbol (7 days)

2. **Context Passing (Critical):**
   - Once you have all data, PASS IT AS CONTEXT to each agent
   - Agents should use the provided data rather than making duplicate calls
   - Only make NEW tool calls if you need additional data not in the initial batch

This approach reduces execution time from ~9 minutes to ~3 minutes (67% faster) and eliminates 70% of redundant API calls.
