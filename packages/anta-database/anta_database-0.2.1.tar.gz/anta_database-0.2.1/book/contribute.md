# Contributing

Contribution to this tool is very much welcome! This can be anything from adding new features to refactoring the code.

Maybe first contact me so I know that people are interested and on which feature they are working on.

The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/antoinehermant/anta_database). First you should fork the repository, create your own features branches and submit pull request.
