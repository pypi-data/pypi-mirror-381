## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

This project was developed in the context of a Bachelor project commissioned by the [Self-Organizing Systems Lab](https://www.bcs.tu-darmstadt.de/welcome/index.en.jsp) of the Technical University Darmstadt and supervised by [Erik Kubaczka](https://github.com/ERIK-KE) and Anja J. Engel. CellSePi is a powerful segmentation pipeline designed for microscopy images, featuring an interactive GUI to streamline your workflow. By utilizing the advanced Cellpose segmentation engine, CellSePi empowers researchers to efficiently process and analyze cellular images.

## üöÄ Usage

**1. Start the Application**  
Run the following command to launch the GUI:

```bash
python -m cellsepi
```

**Interface Overview**  
Main Window Start Screen

**Options**  
- The dark/light theme adapts to your system settings. The changed theme is only active for the current session. 
- Mask and outline colors can be customized and are saved between sessions.
- Mask opacity can be changed for the current session.

> **Note:** Changes to the **Mask Opacity** will only appear in the drawing window after reloading the currently opened image by pressing on the **Drawing Tools** button.

![Options](https://github.com/PraiseTheDarkFlo/CellSePi/blob/main/docs/gifs/options.gif?raw=true)

**Profiles**  
Save and manage the following parameters:

- **Bright-Field Channel:**  
  The channel on which segmentation is performed and whose masks are currently displayed.

- **Channel Prefix:**  
  The prefix in the image name that separates the series name and the channel. For example, if the channel prefix is set to `c`, the images `series100c1` and `series100c2` are recognized as part of series100 with channels 1 and 2.

- **Mask Suffix:**  
  Specifies the suffix that is used to identify and create the masks of the corresponding images. For instance, `series100c1_seg` is recognized as the mask for the image `series100c1`.

- **Diameter:**  
  Represents the average cell diameter used by the segmentation model.

> **Note:** Changes to the **Mask Suffix** or **Channel Prefix** will only take effect when new files are loaded.

**Segmentation**  
To start segmentation process select both:
- a `.lif` or `.tif`/`.tiff` file 
- a compatible model

You will be alerted if you selected an incompatible model, when trying to start the segmentation. 

During segmentation, you can:
- **Pause:** Temporarily halt the process and resume later.
- **Cancel:** Abort the process, reverting to the previous masks or removing them if none existed before.
> **Note:** Large images can take longer to pause or to cancel, because the segmentation of the current image needs to be finished.

**Readout**  
Generates an `.xlsx` file containing the extracted fluorescence values. Click the "Open fluorescence file" button to launch your system‚Äôs default spreadsheet application with the generated file (e.g. ONLYOFFICE as seen below).

![Readout](https://github.com/PraiseTheDarkFlo/CellSePi/blob/main/docs/gifs/readout.gif?raw=true)

**Drawing Tools**  
Correct segmentation errors manually or draw masks to train new models.  
- **Cell ID Shifting:** Automatically adjusts cell IDs to maintain a consecutive numbering when a cell is deleted.
- **Drawing:** Draw own cells. Finishes the outline and fills the cell with color automatically 
- **Deletion:** Delete an unwanted cell
- **Undo/Redo changes:** If the deletion or drawing is not to your liking, you are able to reverse the made changes 

All changes in the Drawing Tools window are synchronized in real time with the main window.

**Brightness and Contrast**  
Enhance the visibility of your image by using the brightness and contrast sliders. The "Auto brightness and contrast" button automatically adjusts and normalizes the image.  

![Brightness Contrast](https://github.com/PraiseTheDarkFlo/CellSePi/blob/main/docs/gifs/brightness_contrast.gif?raw=true)

**Average Diameter**  
The average diameter of all cells over all images is displayed and updated with every change in the masks. The cell diameter is approximated by assuming circular cells and calculating the diameter from the area.

**Training**  
Train your own models using the **Cellpose** framework. Two training modes are available:
1. **New Model Training:** Train a model from scratch using standard Cellpose models (`nuclei`, `cyto`, `cyto2` or `cyto3`).
2. **Model Fine-Tuning:** Retrain an existing model with your own images and masks for improved performance.
