Perfect! Here's your finalized framework titled:

---

# **DIV: Discovery, Implementation, Validation**

## A structured workflow for handling software development requests with context, clarity, and validation.

---

### 🟦 1. Discovery  
**Understand the request in project context.**

- **Inputs**: Request, codebase, documentation, issues/PRs  
- **Activities**: Clarify intent, cross-check knowledge, map to components  
- **Outputs**: Scoped problem statement, mapping to files/issues

---

### 🟨 2. Implementation  
**Deliver a change or provide clarity.**

- **Inputs**: Scoped request, project artifacts  
- **Activities**: Code/config/doc changes OR explanation  
- **Outputs**: PR/commit, updated docs, or clear resolution

---

### 🟩 3. Validation
**Confirm correctness of both understanding and change.**

- **Inputs**: Delivered solution or response, feedback  
- **Activities**: Review, test, confirm with requester  
- **Outputs**: Merged change, validated answer, closed task

---

🔁 **Iterative Flow**: If validation reveals misalignment, loop back to **Discovery** or **Implementation** with refined understanding.

---

This **DIV framework** offers a clean, repeatable model for handling requests — from bug fixes and enhancements to clarifications and investigations — all while staying grounded in the real state of your project.
