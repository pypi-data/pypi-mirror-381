# User Interface Plugin

## Overview

The User Interface plugin provides tools for user interaction and input. This plugin enables communication between the system and the user, allowing for clarification, confirmation, and data collection.

## Resources Provided

### Tools

| Tool Name | Function | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `ask_user` | Prompt user for input/clarification | Asks the user a question and waits for their response, enabling interactive workflows |

## Usage Examples

### Requesting User Input
```json
{
  "tool": "ask_user",
  "question": "What is the name of the new feature you'd like to implement?"
}
```

### Confirming Actions
```json
{
  "tool": "ask_user",
  "question": "Are you sure you want to delete the file 'old_code.py'? This action cannot be undone. (yes/no)"
}
```

### Gathering Information
```json
{
  "tool": "ask_user",
  "question": "Please describe the bug you're experiencing, including steps to reproduce it."
}
```

## Configuration

This plugin does not require any specific configuration. User interaction follows the system's default prompt style and timeout settings.

## Security Considerations

- User input is validated and sanitized before use
- Sensitive operations require explicit confirmation
- Input timeouts prevent indefinite waiting
- Malicious input patterns are detected and blocked

## Integration

The User Interface plugin integrates with the conversation system to provide:

- Interactive decision-making
- Clarification of ambiguous requests
- Collection of user preferences and requirements
- Confirmation of potentially destructive operations

This enables human-guided AI workflows where the system can ask for clarification when needed, ensuring accurate and safe operation.
