# 💬 Janito vs. Web-Based AI Chats

While web-based AI chats (like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot web) are popular for code help, Janito offers significant advantages for project analysis and automation:

## ⏳ Overhead of Manual Copy/Paste

- 🕒 **Time-Consuming:** Copying large files, code snippets, or project structures into a web chat is slow and repetitive.
- 🔍 **Context Loss:** Web chats lack awareness of your full project structure, dependencies, and configuration.
- ⚠️ **Error-Prone:** Manual copy/paste increases the risk of missing files, truncating code, or introducing formatting errors.
- 🚫 **No Automation:** Each session is isolated; you can’t script or automate workflows across your project.

## 🔒 Risks to Accuracy and Privacy

- ❌ **Incomplete Analysis:** Web chats only see what you paste, missing important context or related files.
- 🧑‍💻 **Human Error:** It’s easy to accidentally omit, duplicate, or mislabel code when copying manually.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Privacy Concerns:** Pasting proprietary code into a third-party web service may violate company policy or expose sensitive information.

## 🏆 Janito’s Advantages

- 📂 **Direct Project Access:** Janito can analyze your entire codebase, follow imports, and reference configuration automatically.
- 🔁 **Repeatable & Scriptable:** Automate reviews, refactoring, or documentation with CLI commands and scripts.
- 🧠 **Rich Context:** Tools and prompts can be tailored to your workflow, ensuring the AI sees the right context every time.
- ✂️ **No Copy/Paste Needed:** Save time and reduce mistakes by working directly with your files.

## 🏁 Summary

Janito eliminates the friction, risk, and limitations of manual copy/paste into web chats—delivering faster, more accurate, and more secure project assistance.
