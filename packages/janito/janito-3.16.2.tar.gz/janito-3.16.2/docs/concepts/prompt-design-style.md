# Prompt Design Style: Condition Before Action

## A Key Ordering Principle in Language and Prompt Engineering

In both natural language and prompt engineering, the structure and order of words significantly impact clarity and effectiveness. One notable pattern is the presentation of a condition before the subsequent action—commonly known as the condition before action order. This article explores the prevalence and importance of this structure, especially in contexts where precise instructions or prompts are required.

### What Does Condition Before Action Mean?

The condition before action structure is when a statement specifies a prerequisite or context (the condition) prior to describing the main step or activity (the action). For example:

- **Condition before action:** Before removing or renaming files, update all references and validate the relevant aspects of the system.
- **Action before condition:** Update all references and validate the relevant aspects of the system before removing or renaming files.

While both structures can be grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning, the former more explicitly signals to the reader or listener that fulfillment of the condition must precede the action. This is particularly valuable in technical writing, safety protocols, and instructions that must be followed precisely.

### Linguistic Perspective

From a linguistic standpoint, fronting the condition is a way to foreground critical context. This satisfies a reader's expectation for information sequence: context first, then the result or necessary action. Linguists often refer to this as maintaining logical and temporal coherence, which is essential to effective communication.

### Implications for Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering—the art of crafting effective inputs for large language models (LLMs)—relies on linguistic patterns present in training corpora. Because much of the high-quality material these models learn from (technical documentation, instructions, programming guides) uses condition before action ordering, LLMs are more likely to interpret and execute prompts that follow this structure accurately.

For example, prompting an LLM with:

> Before you create the report, ensure the data is validated.

provides a clear sequence, reducing ambiguity compared to:

> Ensure the data is validated before you create the report.

While LLMs can process both forms, explicit and sequential phrasing aligns better with their linguistic training and often yields more reliable results.

### Why Order Matters

Generalizing beyond just condition before action, order-of-words is a critical factor in communicating instructions, expressing logic, and minimizing misunderstandings. Other important orders include:

- **Cause before effect:** Because the file was missing, the build failed.
- **Reason before request:** Since you're available, could you review this?
- **Qualifier before command:** If possible, finish this by noon.

Each of these helps set context and prevent errors—essential in instructive writing and conversational AI interactions.

### Avoiding Ambiguity: Be Explicit with Actions and Objects

A common source of ambiguity in prompts is the use of vague verbs such as "validate", "check", or "review" without specifying what is being validated, checked, or reviewed, and by what criteria. For example, the instruction "validate the system" is ambiguous: what aspects of the system should be validated, and how?

#### Guideline:
- Avoid vague verbs without a clear object and criteria. Instead, specify what should be validated and how. For example, use "validate the relevant configuration files for syntax errors" or "validate the output matches the expected format".
- When using the condition-before-action structure, ensure both the condition and the action are explicit and unambiguous.

#### Example (generalized):
- **Ambiguous:** Before removing or renaming files, validate the system.
- **Improved:** Before removing or renaming files, validate the relevant aspects of the system (e.g., configuration, dependencies, and references).

#### Note:
The phrase "validate the system before removing or renaming files" does follow the condition-before-action structure, but the object ("the system") should be made more explicit for clarity and reliability.

### Qualifiers, Determinism, and LLM Behavior

#### Are "Always" and "Never" Conditions?

Words like "Always" and "Never" are absolute qualifiers, not true conditions. While they may appear to set clear, deterministic boundaries, their interpretation by large language models (LLMs) is not guaranteed to be consistent. LLMs operate probabilistically, so even instructions with absolute qualifiers can yield unexpected or inconsistent results.

#### Are Qualifiers Ambiguous?

Qualifiers such as "if possible," "always," or "never" can introduce ambiguity, especially in the context of LLMs. While these words are often clear to humans, LLMs may interpret or prioritize them differently depending on context, training data, and prompt structure. This means that even deterministic-sounding qualifiers may not produce deterministic outcomes.

#### Preferred Strategies for Prompt Engineering

Given the non-deterministic, probabilistic nature of LLMs, it is advisable to:
- Prefer explicit, context-setting conditions (e.g., "Before you do X, ensure Y") over absolute or vague modifiers.
- Avoid relying solely on words like "always" or "never" to enforce strict behavior.
- Structure prompts to minimize ambiguity and maximize clarity, aligning with the sequential logic that LLMs are most likely to follow reliably.

This approach reduces the risk of unexpected results and improves the reliability of LLM outputs.

### Conclusion

Whether you're writing documentation, crafting conversational prompts for AI, or giving instructions, placing conditions before actions is an effective way to convey clear, sequential logic. Not only does this habit align with natural linguistic expectations, but it also optimizes your communication for language models trained on human language patterns. In both human communication and AI prompting, condition before action is a foundational principle that promotes understanding and successful outcomes.
